<p>In the annals of the
medical profession the name of
Andreas Vesalius of Brussels holds
a place second to none. Every
physician has heard of him, yet
few know the details of his life,
the circumstances under which
his labors were carried out, the
extent of those labors, or their far-reaching
influence upon the progress of anatomy, physiology
and surgery. Comparatively few physicians have
seen his works; and fewer still have read them. The
reformation which he inaugurated in anatomy, and incidentally
in other branches of medical science, has left
only a dim impress upon the minds of the busy, science-loving
physicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
That so little should be known about him is not surprising,
since his writings were in Latin and were published
prior to the middle of the sixteenth century. His books,
<span class="pb" id="Page_IX">IX</span>
which at one time were in the hands of all the scientific
physicians of Europe, are now rarely encountered beyond
the walls of the great medical libraries of the world. They
are among the <i>incunabula</i> of the medical literature. That
English-speaking physicians know little of Vesalian literature
is due to the fact that no extensive biography of the
great anatomist has appeared in our language. Most of the
Vesalian literature which has been written by English and
American authors has been in the form of brief articles
for the medical press; these oftentimes have been incorrect
and unillustrated. Perhaps the best example of this class
is the article by Mr. Henry Morley which appeared originally
in <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, in 1853, and later was published
in his <i>Clement Marot and Other Studies</i>, in 1871.
The chief data for Vesalius&rsquo;s biography are to be found
in his own writings, in the archives of the Universities in
which he taught, and in the controversial literature of the
period. Extensive as are these sources they leave much
to be desired. A vast mass of Vesalian literature was
printed, chiefly in the Latin language, during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. Much of it is based
on insufficient evidence or on national prejudice. The
Germans, the French, the Dutch and the Italians have all
taken a turn at it. In modern times the monumental
work of Roth, <i>Andreas Vesalius Bruxellensis</i>, Berlin,
1892, has served to epitomize this literature and to make
clear many points which formerly were not understood.
I have taken Roth&rsquo;s book as a basis for this monograph,
without using the voluminous references which are found
in the work of this thorough historian.</p>

<p>The man who overthrew the authority of Galen; revolutionized
the teaching of the structure of the human
body; started anatomical, physiological, and surgical investigation
in the right channels; first correctly illustrated
his dissections; destroyed ancient dogmas, and made many
new discoveries&mdash;this man, Andreas Vesalius of Brussels,
deserves the name which Morley has given him, &ldquo;the
Luther of Anatomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At long intervals a bright particular star appears in the
intellectual horizon, endowed with genius of such a superlative
order as seemingly to comprise within itself the
whole domain of an entire science. These men do not
belong to any particular epoch in the development of the
human mind. They are the eternal symbols of progress,
and their history is the history of the science which they
profess. Such men were Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Newton,
Lavoisier, and Bichat; and such also was Andreas
Vesalius the anatomist. Young, enthusiastic, courageous
and diligent, Vesalius dared to contradict the authority of
Galen, corrected the anatomical mistakes of thirteen centuries
and before his thirtieth year published the most accurate,
complete, and best illustrated treatise on anatomy
that the world had ever seen. His industry, the success
which crowned his efforts, the jealousies which his discoveries
aroused in the breasts of his contemporaries, the
honors which were conferred upon him by Charles the
Fifth and Philip the Second, his pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, and his tragic death&mdash;these are events which deserve
to be chronicled by an abler pen than mine.</p>
<p>The year 1543 marks the date of a revolution which
<span class="pb" id="Page_XI">XI</span>
was won, not by force of arms but by the scalpel of an anatomist
and the hand of an artist. The whole of human
anatomy, as a study involving correct descriptions of the
component parts of the body and accurate delineations
thereof, may be said to have been founded by Andreas
Vesalius and Jan Stephan van Calcar. As light pouring
into a prism attracts little notice until it emerges in iridescent
hues, so it was with anatomy: after passing through
the brain of Vesalius it bore rich fruit which has been
gathered by many hands. To turn from the writings of
Galen, Mondino, Hundt, Peyligk, Phryesen, and Berengario
da Carpi to the beauties of Vesalius&rsquo;s <i>De Humani
Corporis Fabrica</i> is like passing from darkness into sunlight.
To both anatomists and artists this book was a
revelation. For more than a century after its appearance
the anatomists of Europe did little more than make additions
to, and compose commentaries upon the conjoint
triumph of Vesalius and van Calcar. For more than two
centuries the osteologic and myologic figures of the
<i>Fabrica</i> formed the basis of all treatises on Art-Anatomy.</p>

</div>
<p>The intelligent student of
medical history has at his command
an unfailing source of pleasure. To
learn the successive steps by which
Medicine has advanced from a priest-ridden
and secret art practiced with
mysterious rites in the Greek temples,
passing through the schools of Greek philosophy into the
light of publicity, is his privilege. To hunt through
musty and worm-eaten volumes for facts regarding the
great physicians of antiquity is his delight; and to communicate
the knowledge thus obtained to others, who
have not the time or the facilities for such research, is his
duty. In every period are events and incidents of interest,
but to the Middle Ages a peculiar fascination attaches;
for it was during this period that Europe, emerging from
an intellectual darkness of ten centuries&rsquo; duration, awoke
to the Renaissance, and Medicine, as ever has been the
case, kept pace with the general advance of knowledge.</p>
<p>The present book deals with the life of a master
whose work was an essential factor in the evolution of
the Anatomical Renaissance. In order to understand the
New Birth of Anatomy it is necessary to know something
of the scope and influence of the General Renaissance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h3>The General Renaissance</h3>
<p>This, the Revival of Learning, includes an indefinite
time in European history. The seeds of the new movement
were planted in the Middle Ages, but they bore no
fruit until the time had arrived for an apparently &ldquo;spontaneous
outburst of intelligence&rdquo;. Definitions of the
Renaissance will vary with the point of view. Artists and
sculptors will say it was a revolution which was created
by the recovery of ancient statues; litt&eacute;rateurs and philosophers
look upon it as a radical change due to the discovery
of the writings of the classical authors; astronomers
and physicists will cite the names of Copernicus, Galileo,
and Torricelli; geographers will point to the discovery of
a New Continent; historians will name the extinction of
feudalism and the capture of Constantinople by the Turks;
inventors will recall the changed conditions of warfare
brought about by gunpowder, the multiplication of books
by the invention of printing, and the advent of new methods
of engraving; and anatomists will sound the praises
of Leonardo da Vinci and of Andreas Vesalius. All will
agree that the Renaissance meant Revolution&mdash;revolution
in thought, in conduct, in creed, and in conditions of
existence. To no one fact can the Renaissance be attributed;
nor can its scope be limited to any one field of human
endeavor. The Renaissance was, and is, and will
continue to be, as long as the race progresses.</p>
<p>The new movement began in Italy and grew rapidly.
When, toward the end of the sixteenth century, the lamp
of learning began to get dim in Italy, it was relighted by
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the nations of northern Europe&mdash;the Germans, the Hollanders,
and the English&mdash;and by them was transferred to
us. The Revival consisted largely in the recovery of the
buried writings of the ancient Greek and Roman authors,
together with comments on what they had written, and
the production of books which were modeled after their
works. But it was broader than this. It included all
branches of learning, although more progress was made
in some lines than in others.</p>
<p>Italy, a country divided into numerous small States,
and so-called Republics, offered great opportunities for
individual development and became famous in those paths
in which individualism has gained its greatest triumphs.
Thus in literature, in law, in medicine, in painting and in
sculpture, the Italians were pre&euml;minent. In architecture
and in the drama they reached no such heights as were
attained by the French, the Germans and the English. It
was in the northwest part of Italy, in the province of
Tuscany, that the Renaissance gained its greatest victories.
Among the earliest of the leaders of the New Learning
was the Florentine poet, Dante Alighieri (1265-1321).
&ldquo;To Dante&rdquo;, says Symonds, &ldquo;in a truer sense than to any
other poet, belongs the double glory of immortalising in
verse the centuries behind him, while he inaugurated the
new age&rdquo;. His <i>Vita Nuova</i> (New Life) and <i>Divina Commedia</i>
(Divine Comedy) are essentially modern in thought,
but ancient in the manner in which the thought is expressed.</p>
<p>Petrarch may be said to fairly open the new era.
Like Dante, he was a Florentine. He was the apostle of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Humanism, that system of philosophy which regarded
man &ldquo;as a rational being apart from theological determinations&rdquo;
and perceived that &ldquo;classic literature alone
displayed human nature in the plenitude of intellectual
and moral freedom&rdquo;. To a revolt against the despotism
of the Church, it added the attempt to unify all that had
been taught and done by man. Petrarch was a poet, a
lawyer, an orator, a priest, and a philosopher. He lived
between the years 1304-1374. He was a great traveler,
and visited the leading continental cities in order to converse
with learned men. Petrarch delighted in the study
of Cicero, in collecting manuscripts, and in accumulating
coins and inscriptions for historic purposes. He advocated
public libraries and preached the duty of preserving
ancient monuments. He opposed the physicians and
astrologers of his day, and ridiculed the followers of
Averr&ouml;es.</p>
<p>Boccaccio, who has been called the Father of Italian
Prose, and is most widely known as the author of the
<i>Decameron</i>, did not spend all of his time in describing
the escapades of the knights and ladies of old. Influenced
potently by Petrarch, Boccaccio regretted the years he
had wasted in law and trade, when he should have been
reading the classics. Late in life he began the study of
Greek that he might read the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>.
What he lacked in genuine scholarship he made up in
industry. He continued the work begun by Petrarch of
hunting for lost manuscripts of the ancient Greek and
Roman authors. Many of these precious documents
were stored in the conventual libraries, where, too often,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
they were either wantonly destroyed or were mutilated,
the words of the author being erased from the parchment
to make way for new prayers. Boccaccio tells of a visit
which he made to the Benedictine Monastery of Monte
Cassino near the city of Salernum. He wished to see the
books and found them in a room without door or key.
Many of them were mutilated. On making inquiry as to
the cause, the monks answered that they had sold some of
the sheets, having first erased the original words, replacing
them with psalters. The margins of the old pages were
made into charms and were sold to women.</p>
<p>It was owing to the unselfish labors of such men as
Petrarch and Boccaccio that the works of Livy, Cicero,
Quintilian, Terence, and others of the ancient authors,
were preserved. In this enterprise they were encouraged
by the rulers. Thus Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici in Florence,
Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples, and Nicholas V. in
Rome, to say nothing of the despots of the smaller cities,
rivaled one another in their zeal in unearthing and multiplying
the manuscripts of the ancient writers. They
spared neither time nor money to increase their store of
manuscript books. They surrounded themselves with
learned men who lived in high esteem, and who were
supported by salaries paid by the State or by private
pensions.</p>
<p>The fifteenth century, which was one of the most
remarkable epochs in history, was rich in accomplishment.
Almost all of the great events which have influenced
European commercial and intellectual development
can be traced to that period. The invention of printing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the discovery of America, the fall of the Roman Empire
in the East, the birth of the Reformation, and the rise of
art in Italy, all belong to this wonderful century. In this
period, when almost every city in Italy was a new Athens,
the Italian poets, historians, and artists vied with the eminent
men of the ancient world in carrying the lamp of
learning. The Italian cities&mdash;Florence, Bologna, Milan,
Venice, Rome and Ferrara&mdash;fought with one another, not
for the spoils of the battlefield but for the victories of
science and of art; not so much for the profits of commerce
as for the wealth of genius and of learning. The
intellectual development which occurred in northern
Italy under the rule of the house of Medici, and particularly
under the auspices of Lorenzo the Magnificent,
forms one of the most interesting periods in European
history.</p>
<p>It is impossible in the present work to trace the steps
by which the exquisite taste of the ancients in works of art
was revived in modern times. Nevertheless, a few words
may be devoted to this subject. While much must be credited
to those Greek artists who had left their country and
had settled in the Italian peninsula, it must be conceded
that many of the works of art of the native Italians were
not the less meritorious. The same circumstances which
favored the revival of letters, operated to further the cause
of art; and the same individuals, who were interested in the
preservation of the manuscripts of the older authors, also
busied themselves with the collection of ancient statues,
paintings, gems and tapestry. The freedom of the Italian
Republics permitted the minds of men to expand to full
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
fruition; and the encouragement which was given by its
rulers to artists, sculptors and artisans, made the city of
Florence, in the fifteenth century, a not less renowned
centre of culture than Athens had been in ancient times.</p>
<p>The revival of art dates from the time of Cimabue
(1240-1300) and Giotto (1276-1336). The former is known
as the Father of Modern Painters; the latter constructed
the Campanile at Florence. To Giovanni Cimabue, scion
of a noble Florentine family, is usually given the credit of
being the restorer of art in Italy. He is thought to have
been the first painter to throw expression into the human
countenance. His work, if judged by present standards,
would be called crude, rude and incomplete. Much of
the fame of this painter is to be attributed to his being
the first person whom Vasari chronicled in his <i>Lives of
the Painters</i>. For more than a century after the time of
Cimabue and Giotto, painters displayed only a smattering
of anatomical knowledge.</p>
<p>Early in the fifteenth century two Flemish artists,
Hubert van Eyck (1365-1426) and his brother John (1385-1441),
in their polyptych of the Adoration of the Lamb,
boldly struck out along new lines and committed the unheard-of
deed of painting nude figures. Italy, however,
was the real birthplace of Art-Anatomy. While the
Flemings and others of the North painted everything that
they saw, including the nude, the Italians were the first
men of the Renaissance who thought of painting the nude
figure before draping it. Leo Battista Alberti (1404-1472),
in his works on painting, insists that the bony
skeleton must first be drawn and then clothed with its
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
muscles and flesh. This was an important step in advance,
since it shows that the Florentine artists were progressing
towards realism and were breaking away from
the symbolism of the early Christian painters and mosaic-workers.
The new movement in art found a worthy
champion in Antonio Pollaiuolo (1432-1498). In his
knowledge of the anatomy of the human figure he surpassed
all of the artists of his day; and as a result of his
labors he may justly be named the founder of the scientific
study of the nude. His knowledge of anatomy was
so accurate, and so extensive, that it could have been
gained only in the dissecting room.</p>
<p>Under the patronage of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici and the
guiding mind of Pollaiuolo, there occurred a revival of
pseudo-paganism in Art. The old Church subjects were
largely neglected; mythological subjects again became
the fashion; draperies were either modified or were laid
aside; and the scientific study of anatomy, both as regards
the nude figure and the dissection of the individual parts,
became the necessary training of the student. Of all the
masters of this period, the palm for excellence in drawing
the naked figure must be awarded to Luca Signorelli
(1442-1524), from whose work Michael Angelo is known
to have profited.</p>
<p>The alliance between skilled anatomists and master
artists was of reciprocal benefit. The anatomical studies
which were made conjointly by Leonardo da Vinci and
the celebrated teacher of anatomy, Marc Antonio della
Torre, were lost to the world by the untimely death of
the latter, before he had finished a magnificent treatise
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
on human anatomy. Leonardo&rsquo;s anatomical sketches, if
they had been published during his lifetime, would have
revolutionized anatomy both as regards discoveries in the
body and the teaching of the structure of man. These
masterpieces of anatomical illustration long remained
hidden from the world; they were published only in the
year 1902. Even now their cost is so great that only a
few wealthy libraries can possess them. Leonardo&rsquo;s long
unpublished drawings show him to have been a most accurate
anatomist. At the same time, he constantly kept
in view the aim of fine art, which, in so far as practical
anatomy is concerned, needs a knowledge of only the
bones and the muscles.</p>
<p>Nor was Leonardo the only artist who made dissections.
Raffaello Santi, Michael Angelo, Bartholomaus
Torre, Luigi Cardi or Civoli, Jan Stephan van Calcar,
Giuseppe Ribera, Arnold Myntens, and Pietro da Cortona
studied practical anatomy. Rubens&rsquo;s long-lost sketch-book<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>,
which was published one hundred and thirty-three
years after his death, shows with what care he had studied
human anatomy. Albrecht D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s <i>Treatise on the Proportions
of the Human Body</i> is also worthy of mention.</p>
<p>In the number and fame of her Universities, Italy showed
supremacy. At the end of the fifteenth century she
could boast of sixteen seats of learning, a number equal
to that of the combined institutions of Britain, France,
Germany, Hungary, Bohemia and Bavaria.</p>
<p>This digression has led us away from the Humanists.
Their list is a long one. Among them were Poggio
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Bracciolini, who discovered the manuscript of the <i>Institutions</i>
of Quintilian and the writings of Vitruvius; Poliziano,
the first poet of the fifteenth century, and the translator
of the works of Hippocrates and Galen; Pontanus,
whose <i>De Stellis</i> and <i>Urania</i> were much admired by
Italian scholars; Sannazzaro, whose epic on the birth of
Christ cost him twenty years of labor; Vida, whose <i>Christiad</i>
and other poems were much admired; and Fracastoro,
whose <i>Syphilis</i> was hailed as a divine poem.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of the medical historian an important
event occurred in the year 1443, when Thomas
of Sarzana, later known as Pope Nicholas V., discovered
a manuscript copy of the <i>De Medicina</i> of Aulus Cornelius
Celsus. This classic, which had been lost for many centuries,
was one of the first medical books to pass through
the press. It gave physicians an insight into Hippocratic
medicine without the disadvantage of an imperfect translation.
Physicians took an active part in the Renaissance.
Thus Nicholas Leonicenus, of Ferrara, translated the
<i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates and the <i>Natural History</i> of
Pliny; and Winter of Andernach did similar labor for
the writings of Galen, Alexander, and Paulus Aegineta.
Their efforts seem insignificant in comparison with those
of Anutius Foesius, a humble practitioner of Metz, who
spent forty years of his life in preparing a complete Greek
edition of the works of Hippocrates. The New Learning
was brought to England by two physicians, Thomas
Linacre and John Kaye (Caius).</p>
<p>Some of the Humanists were printers. The history of
printing in Italy naturally forms a part of the history of
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the Renaissance. In 1462, Maintz was pillaged by Adolph
of Nassau and its printers were scattered over Europe.
Two of them wandered into Italy, living in a village in the
Sabine mountains, where, in October, 1465, the first book
was printed from an Italian press. It was a Latin edition
of Lactantius. Six years later a press was established in
Florence. In 1478, Mondino&rsquo;s <i>Anathomia</i> was printed in
Pavia. It has been estimated that before the first year of
the sixteenth century, five thousand books had been printed
in Italy. In those days the editions were small, 265
copies being considered one edition. An immense amount
of labor was required to get out a new edition. First, the
manuscripts of the ancient author had to be collected,
compared and corrected, this work being done by learned
men who resided in the home of the publisher. The corrections
were made without the aid of dictionaries, grammars,
or book-helps of any kind. The proof was read
aloud to the assembled scholars and the final corrections
were added. In time, Venice came to be the most noted
of the Italian cities in the publishing business, owing
chiefly to the family of Aldo. This family of printers became
famous for finely printed Greek and Latin books,
which are still called Aldine editions. Nine years after
the printing of the first book in Italy, the art was practiced
in England by Caxton.</p>
<p>Humanism in Italy began to decline toward the close
of the fifteenth century. Long before this time it had
degenerated into Paganism. The scholars influenced
all life, customs and thought. Although the nation remained
Catholic, it was such only in name. Everyone
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
bowed before the shrine of classical literature. Even in
the christening of children the Christian name was sacrificed
to paganism. The saints were forgotten, and the
names most frequently chosen were those from heathen
mythology. The polite authors described scenes, events
and actions in their writings in terms which long since
have been banished from good society. A spade was
called by its true name. Bembo, the secretary of Leo X.,
could write a hymn to Saint Stephen or a monologue for
Priapus with equal ease and elegance. The amours of the
high and the low were flaunted in print. The nation degenerated
into an intellectual and sensual state which involved
even the Popes. Scholars and rich men alike vied
with one another in returning to those pursuits, habits,
and methods of thought which had ruled ancient Rome
in her most corrupt days.</p>
<p>Such a condition could not exist forever. The turning-point
came in 1527, when Charles the Fifth, engaging in
war with Pope Clement VII., captured and sacked the
city of Rome. After that event everything was changed.
Not only had the scholars lost their influence, but many
of them had lost their lives. Valeriano, who returned to
Rome after the siege, pathetically exclaims: &ldquo;Good God!
when first I began to enquire for the philosophers, orators,
poets and professors of Greek and Latin literature, whose
names were written on my tablets, how great, how horrible
a tragedy was offered to me! Of all those lettered
men whom I had hoped to see, how many had perished
miserably, carried off by the most cruel of all fates, overwhelmed
by undeserved calamities; some dead of plague,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
some brought to a slow end by penury in exile, others
slaughtered by a foeman&rsquo;s sword, others worn out by daily
tortures; some, again, and these of all the most unhappy,
driven by anguish to self-murder&rdquo;. Such was the end of
the men who made the Italian Renaissance. The Spaniards,
the Inquisition, and the changed policy of the
Church prevented a second revival of Humanism.</p>
<p>While the sack of Rome marks the end of the Humanists,
the Revival in Medicine continued to grow in vigor and
extent. Many of the greatest discoveries in anatomy were
made, and most of the important books on this subject were
written, in the middle and latter part of the sixteenth century.
Italian history is rich in contradictions. While peace,
ease and comfort are generally considered to be necessary
to the development of science and culture, Italy offers
the strange spectacle of the steady increase in medical
knowledge in spite of wars and alarms. The Inquisition,
which had been introduced from Spain in 1224, was given
a new and horrible impetus when, in 1540, Paul III. appointed
six cardinals to add to its tortures. One of them,
Caraffa, became Pope Paul IV. in 1555, and four years
later originated the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>. Torn by civil
and foreign wars, and terrorized by the Inquisition, which
was not abolished until late in the eighteenth century,
Italy gradually lost her commercial and intellectual supremacy.
That she should have accomplished so much
under such unfavorable circumstances, is now a matter
of wonderment.</p>
<p>The origin of the Renaissance in Italy was due to
many causes. The early Roman civilization was not entirely
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
blotted out by the invasion of the barbarians of the
North. And in the matter of language the Italians possessed
an advantage, since the transition from Latin to
Italian was easier than from Latin to Spanish, French,
English or German. The fertility of the country; the
mildness of the climate; the division into semi-independent
states; the infusion of new northern blood into the
veins of the Italians; the removal of the papal court to
Avignon in 1309; and the gradual rise of a powerful middle
class, whose members included the devotees of the
professions of law and medicine, were factors which determined
that Italy, rather than France or Spain, should
be the field for the Revival of Letters.</p>
<p>To Italy, then, belongs the glory of having been the
first to free herself from the trammels of ancient scholasticism
and the fetters of mediaeval theology. She abandoned
the wordy dialectics and metaphysical gymnastics
of the philosophers of old. In place of mortification,
penance and solitary confinement in cloistered monasteries
and convents, she began to have a proper conception
of the dignity of man and his relation to nature.</p>
<p>Italy, in the time of her freedom, received the torch
of learning from Greece; Italy revived its brilliancy, and,
when her time of adversity and ruin arrived, she passed it
on to the nations of Northern Europe. They in turn
have transferred it to America, to Australia, to India, and
to the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>
<h3>The Anatomical Renaissance</h3>
<p>Italy in the sixteenth century was the fount from which
issued a ceaseless stream of anatomical discoveries. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
ancient and illustrious Universities of Bologna, Pavia,
Padua, Pisa and Rome, eclipsed the schools of Paris and
Montpellier, of Toulouse and Salamanca; and the Italian
peninsula, which, in early mediaeval times, had gloried in
the skill of the physicians of Salernum, a second time became
the medical centre of Europe. Vesalius and his
pupil, Fallopius, taught at Padua; the ancient fame of
Bologna was supported by Arantius and Varolius; Vidius,
returned from establishing the anatomical school at Paris,
taught at Pisa; Eustachius was at Rome, Ingrassias lectured
at Naples, and the fame of the New Anatomy spread
throughout the world. The Italian cities were filled with
students from foreign lands. Padua had more than one
thousand new students every year, salaries were paid to
her one hundred professors, and medicine was looked
upon as a noble profession.</p>
<p>While the Italians were the leaders in progress, the
Germans were still lecturing on Galen and Avicenna, the
English had done almost nothing, and the Coll&eacute;ge de
France was not established until 1530.</p>
<p>Legalized by imperial authority and sanctioned by the
Church, dissection was no longer regarded as a crime. A
bull by Pope Boniface VIII., issued in the year 1300, forbidding
the evisceration of the dead and the boiling of
their bodies to secure the bones for consecrated ground,
as was done by the Crusaders, was wrongly interpreted as
forbidding anatomical dissection. Two centuries later the
Popes, standing in the vanguard of science, permitted dissections
to be made in all the Italian medical schools,
and paved the way for the Anatomical Renaissance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Great things were done in the sixteenth century. Under
the scalpel and pen of Vesalius, anatomy was revolutionized.
Surgery was guided into new paths by Ambroise
Par&eacute;; and obstetrics, thanks to the labors of Eucharius
Rhodion and Jacques Guillemeau, began to assume its
legitimate place among the medical sciences. Servetus,
visionary and argumentative, correctly described the pulmonary
circulation in a theological work which was burned
with its author. Eustachius, Columbus and Fallopius
widened the path which had been blazed by Vesalius.
Arantius, Caesalpinus and Fabricius added materially to
anatomical science. The labors of all these great masters
prepared the way for the greatest event occurring in the
seventeenth century, namely, William Harvey&rsquo;s discovery
of the circulatory movement of the blood.</p>

<p>Egypt and Greece were the
sources of the medical learning of the
ancient world. Although the Egyptians
and early Greeks possessed a certain
amount of anatomical knowledge,
which was gained in the one instance
by the practice of embalming and in
the other by an examination of the bones, no real progress
could be made because of the laws, customs and prejudices
of those ancient peoples. Thus we find the Egyptians
stoning the operator who opened the abdomen in
order that the body might be embalmed; and the Greeks
inflicted the death penalty on those of their generals who,
after a battle, neglected to bury or burn the remains of
the slain.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p_p017a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="594" />
<p class="pcap">HIPPOCRATES</p>
</div>
<p>In the time of Hippocrates,
whose life extended
approximately over the period
between 460-377 B.C.,
Greek medicine emerged
from the domination of the
Asclepiadae, or priests of
Aesculapius, who had followed
it as an hereditary
and secret art. Prior to this
time in the numerous Asclepia,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
or Temples of Aesculapius, votive offerings had
been accepted, some of which were of anatomical interest.
Thus the Temple at Athens received a silver heart and
gold eyes. Pausanias states that Hippocrates gave to the
Temple of Apollo, at Delphos, a skeleton which was
made of brass. Possibly, as Moehsen<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> believes, this was
a metallic figure representing a man who was much emaciated
by the ravages of disease. In the Hippocratic
writings, some of which are undoubtedly spurious, are few
references to the opening of a dead body; and these examinations
concern the investigation of the thorax and
abdomen in order to determine the cause of death. While
the Greek physicians knew little of the human muscles,
of the nervous system and of the organs of sense, they
were well acquainted with the anatomy of the bones.
Their dissections were held upon the lower animals.</p>
<p>It is impossible to determine whether or not the Greek
physicians of the Hippocratic period dissected the human
body. &ldquo;It has long been a matter of debate&rdquo;, says John
Bell<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>, &ldquo;whether the ancients were, or were not, acquainted
with anatomy, and the subject, with its various bearings,
has been much and keenly agitated by the learned.
If anatomy had been much known to the ancients, their
knowledge would not have remained a subject of speculation.
We should have had evidence of it in their works;
but, on the contrary, we find Hippocrates spending his
time in idle prognostics, and dissecting apes, to discover
the seat of the bile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Galen<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> states that the ancient physicians did not write
works on anatomy; that such treatises were at that time
unnecessary, because the Asclepiadae&mdash;to which family
Hippocrates belonged&mdash;secretly
instructed their
young men in this subject;
and that opportunities were
given for such study in the
temples of Aesculapius.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p_p019.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">ARISTOTLE</p>
</div>
<p>The first systematic dissections
seem to have been
made by the Pythagorean
philosopher Alcmaeon,
who lived in the sixth century
B. C., but it is uncertain whether he dissected brutes
or men. The cochlea of the ear and the amnios of the
foetus were named by Empedocles of Agrigentum, in the
fifth century B. C. The nerves were first distinguished
from the tendons by Aristotle, (384-322 B. C.), the most
celebrated zo&ouml;tomist of antiquity, who has been called
the Father of Comparative Anatomy. For twenty centuries
his views of natural phenomena were held in high
esteem.</p>
<p>For a long period the early inhabitants of Rome were
practically without physicians. During severe epidemics
they had recourse to oracles, to the health deities of the
Greeks, and to their native gods. As early as the fifth
century B. C., during a pestilence, a temple was erected
to Apollo as Healer. The worship of Aesculapius was
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
introduced into Rome in the year 291 B. C. Livy relates
that the god of medicine in the guise of a serpent was
transported from Epidaurus, in Greece, to the Isle of the
Tiber where a temple was built in his honor.</p>
<p>The Romans, like the Greeks, were accustomed to
leave votive offerings, or donaria, in their temples. Such
gifts included surgical instruments, pharmaceutical appliances,
painted tablets representing miraculous cures, and
great numbers of images of various parts of the human
frame shaped in metal, stone or terra-cotta. Among the
remains of Roman anatomical art is the marble figure
which was unearthed in the villa of Antonius Musa, the
favorite physician of the Emperor Augustus. It is a human
torso; the front of the chest and abdomen has been
removed so as to expose the
viscera. The heart is placed
vertically in the middle
of the thorax, thus corresponding
to the position of
this organ as described by
Galen who made his dissections
on apes. It is a
human thorax with simian
contents. The figure is
supposed to have been constructed
for the purposes of a teacher of anatomy.</p>

<p class="pcap">ALEXANDER THE GREAT</p>
</div>
<p>It was in the famous Alexandrian University that human
anatomy was first studied systematically and legally.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great, after the fall of Tyre (332 B. C.)
and the siege of Gaza, ordered his fleet to sail up the Nile
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
as far as Memphis while he proceeded overland with the
army. It was probably on this march, while viewing the
pyramids and other marvelous works of the ancient
Egyptians, that he conceived the grand idea of founding
a city upon the banks of the Nile, which should be a model
of architectural beauty, a centre of intellectual life and
a lasting monument of his own greatness and magnificence.
The foundation of Alexandria was laid by the
warrior whose name it bears; but the credit of instituting
the Library belongs to one of his lieutenants, Ptolemy
Soter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p_p021.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="593" />
<p class="pcap">PTOLEMY SOTER</p>
</div>
<p>The new city which for centuries was the intellectual
and commercial storehouse of Europe, Africa and India,
was of oblong form. Lake
Mareotis washed its walls
on the south, while the
Mediterranean bathed its
ramparts on the north. Provided
with broad streets,
it was adorned with magnificent
houses, temples
and public buildings. At
the centre of the city was
the Mausoleum in which
was deposited the body of Alexander, embalmed after the
manner of the Egyptians. Alexandria was divided into
three parts: the <i>Regio Judaeorum</i> or Jews&rsquo; quarter, in
the northwest; the <i>Rhacotis</i>, or Egyptian section, on the
west, containing the Serapeum with a large part of the
Library; and on the north, the <i>Bruchaeum</i>, or Greek portion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
containing the greater part of the Library, the Museum,
the Temple of the Caesars and the Court of Justice.
The population was cosmopolitan in character; the statues
of the Greek gods stood by the side of those of Osiris
and of Isis; the Jews forgot their language and spoke
Greek; and under the Ptolemies, who were of Greek descent,
Alexandria became a centre of intellectual life and
culture.</p>
<p>To the medical historian the most interesting feature
of Alexandria was the Museum or University. Here were
assembled the intellectual giants of the earth: Archimedes
and Hero, the philosophers; Apelles, the painter;
Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the astronomers; Euclid, the
geometer; Eratosthenes and Strabo, the geographers;
Manetho, the historian; Aristophanes, the rhetorician;
Theocritus and Callimichus, the poets; and Erasistratus
and Herophilus, the anatomists, all of whom labored in
quiet upon the peaceful banks of the Nile. The early
Christian church drew from &ldquo;the divine school at Alexandria&rdquo;
such eminent teachers as Origen and Athanasius.
Here were a chemical laboratory, a botanical and zo&ouml;logical
garden, an astronomical observatory, a great library,
and a room for the dissection of the dead.</p>
<p>In the Alexandrian school of medicine Erasistratus
and Herophilus taught the science of organization from
actual dissections. The generosity of the Ptolemies not
only furnished them with an abundance of dead material,
but condemned malefactors were used for human vivisection.
Celsus<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> states that the Alexandrian anatomists obtained
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
criminals, &ldquo;for dissection alive, and contemplated,
even while they breathed, those parts which nature had
before concealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herophilus made many anatomical discoveries. He
traced the delicate arachnoid membrane into the ventricles
of the brain, which he held to be the seat of the soul; and
first described that junction of the six cerebral sinuses opposite
the occipital protuberance, which to this day is
called the <i>torcular Herophili</i>. He saw the lacteals, but
knew not their use, and regarded the nerves as organs of
sensation arising from the brain; he described the different
tunics of the eye, giving them names which are still
retained; and first named the duodenum and discovered
the epididymis. He attributed the pulsation of arteries
to the action of the heart; the paralysis of muscles to an
affection of the nerves; and first named the furrow in the
fourth cerebral ventricle, calling it <i>calamus scriptorius</i>.</p>
<p>Erasistratus gave names to the auricles of the heart;
declared that the veins were blood-vessels; and the arteries,
from being found empty after death, were air-vessels.
He believed that the purpose of respiration was to fill the
arteries with air; the air distended the arteries, made them
beat, and in this manner the pulse was produced. When
once the air gained entrance to the left ventricle, it became
the vital spirits. The function of the veins was to
carry blood to the extremities. He is said to have had a
vague idea of the division of nerves into nerves of sensation
and of motion; to the former he assigned an origin
in the membranes of the brain, while the latter proceeded
from the cerebral substance itself. He recognized the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
use of the trachea as the tube which conveys air to the
lungs. A catheter, the first invented, which was figured
in ancient surgical works, bore the name of the catheter
of Erasistratus. He gravely tells us, as the result of his
anatomical studies, that the soul is located in the membranes
of the brain.</p>
<p>The practice of human dissection did not long exist
in the city of its origin, and after the second century
was unknown. Then science underwent a retrogression;
observations and experiments were replaced by useless
discussions and subtle theories. The decline of the Alexandrian
University was due to a series of disasters which
began with the Roman domination and reached their climax
with the capture of the city by the Arabs.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p_p024.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="640" />
<p class="pcap">GALEN</p>
</div>
<p>Claudius Galenus, the celebrated
Roman physician whose
writings were for centuries accepted
as authority and whose
reputation was second only to
that of Hippocrates, was obliged
to base his anatomical treatises
largely upon the dissection
of the lower animals. He advised
his pupils to visit Alexandria,
where he had studied, in
order that they might examine the human skeleton. He
complained that the physicians of his time&mdash;in the reign
of Marcus Aurelius&mdash;had entirely neglected anatomical
knowledge and had degenerated into mere sophists. He
appreciated the importance of anatomy, particularly to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
surgeon who is called upon to treat wounds and injuries.
Hence he has endeavored in the four books, <i>De Anatomicis
Administrationibus</i>, to cover this part of anatomy
as exhaustively as possible.</p>
<p>Galen&rsquo;s voluminous writings form a precious monument
of ancient medicine. The works of the Alexandrian
anatomists having been destroyed, we know of their labors
chiefly from what Galen has said of them. His treatises
show a remarkable familiarity with practical anatomy, although
his dissections were made upon the lower animals.
Galen&rsquo;s knowledge of osteology was extensive. He described
the bones of the skull, the cranial sutures, and the
essential features of the malar, maxillary, ethmoid and
sphenoid bones. He divided the vertebrae into cervical,
dorsal and lumbar classes. He knew that both arteries
and veins were blood-carrying vessels; he described the
valves of the heart, and recognized this organ as the source
of pulsation. He erroneously taught that the interventricular
septum presents foramina through which the two
kinds of blood become mixed.</p>
<p>In myology Galen made numerous advances. &ldquo;Previous
to his investigations&rdquo;, says Fisher<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> &ldquo;much confusion
existed as to what constituted a single muscle; he adopted
the general rule of considering each bundle of fibers
that terminates in an independent tendon to be one muscle.
He was the first to describe and give names to the
platysma myoides, the sterno- and thyro-hyoides, and the
popliteal. He described the six muscles of the eye, two
muscles of the eyelids, and four pairs of muscles of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
lower jaw&mdash;the temporal to raise, the masseter to draw to
one side, and two depressors, corresponding to the digastric
and internal pterygoid muscles. He described also
the brachialis anticus, the biceps flexor cubiti, the sphincter
and levator ani, and the straight and oblique muscles
of the abdomen. In short, he described the greater portion
of the muscles of the body, his treatise differing
chiefly from a modern one in the minute account of these
organs and in the omission of some of the smaller muscles.&rdquo;
Galen studied the brain and named the corpus
callosum, the septum lucidum, the corpora quadrigemina
and the fornix; but erroneously stated that the nerves of
sensation arise from the brain, and those of motion from
the spinal cord. He denied the decussation of the optic
nerves. He described the pneumogastric and sympathetic
nerves; seven pairs of cerebral and thirty pairs of spinal
nerves; and claimed the discovery of the ganglia of
the nervous system. He located the seat of the soul in
the brain, which also is the source of the rational mind;
the heart to him was the source of courage and of anger,
and the liver was the seat of desire. Many of Galen&rsquo;s
anatomical statements show that he derived his knowledge
from comparative dissections.</p>
<p>The Galenic era was followed by that long period of ignorance,
of slumber and of inaction which is justly known
as the Dark Ages. While a few Greek and Arab writers,
who came after Galen, contributed to the literature of medicine
and surgery, they did nothing for anatomy. After
the end of the fifth century even the works of Galen were
forgotten. At this period, when medicine was chiefly in
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the hands of the Jews, the Arabs and the bigoted clergy,
nothing was done for science or for art. The whole influence
of Christianity was exerted against the schools of
philosophy. Illustrious apostles of the Church pronounced
anathemas against the reading of the ancient classics;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
and eminent ecclesiastics regarded disease as a divine penalty
or as an invaluable aid to saintly advancement. Art
and anatomy were practically forgotten. Their Renaissance
occurred almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>During the period from the seventh to the fourteenth
centuries the school of Salernum was for medicine what
Bologna became for law and Paris for philosophy. Here,
for eight hundred years, medicine was taught to thousands
of students and the impress of the profession was so potent
that the city called itself <i>Civitas Hippocratica</i>, and thus its
seals were stamped. Here medical diplomas were first
issued to waiting students who took a sacred oath to serve
the poor without pay. Here with a book in his hand, a
ring on his finger and a laurel wreath on his head, the
candidate was kissed by each professor and was told to
start upon his way. Here women were professors and
vied with men in spreading the doctrines of our art.</p>
<p>For a period of several hundred years anatomy was
taught at Salernum from dissections made upon pigs.
Copho, one of the Salernian professors of the early part
of the twelfth century, wrote a treatise, <i>Anatomia Porci</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
which gives minute directions regarding the manner in
which the animal is to be dissected. Another anatomical
work of later date, written by a member of the Salernian
faculty, is entitled <i>Demonstratio Anatomica</i>; it also deals
only with comparative anatomy. In the thirteenth century
(A. D. 1231) Frederick II., Emperor of Germany and
King of the Two Sicilies, and the author of a treatise
which contained a complete anatomy of the falcon, decreed
that a human body should be anatomized at Salernum
at least once in five years. Physicians and surgeons
of the kingdom were required to be present at the dissection.
So far as is known, no record has been kept of
these demonstrations. Creditable as was this anatomic
decree, the great Hohenstaufen in other respects was not
free from the errors of his age. A firm believer in <i>Medicina
Astrologica</i>, he did not decide upon any undertaking
until the stars had been consulted.</p>
<p>It was not alone at Salernum that dissection was legalized
in the thirteenth century. A document of the year
1308, of the Maggiore Consiglio of Venice, shows that a
medical college located in that city was authorized to dissect
a body once a year. This, and other isolated examples,
indicate that the time was approaching when anatomy
should be taught from human dissections. The credit of
reinaugurating the teaching of this useful department of
science belongs to Mondino dei Luzzi of Bologna.</p>

<br />Mondino, the Restorer of Anatomy</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_p029.jpg" alt="Illuminated capital" width="150" height="153" />
</div>
<p>In the year 1315, in the old
Italian city of Bologna, an event occurred
which marks an important epoch in
the history of medicine. A wondering
crowd of medical students witnessed
the dissection of a human cadaver&mdash;one
of the few procedures of the kind that
had occurred since the fall of the Alexandrian University.
Acting under royal authority Mondino, a man far in advance
of the age, placed the body of a female upon a table
where for many centuries before only the cadavera of apes,
of swine and of dogs had been studied.</p>
<p>Mondino, known also as Mundinus, Mundini, Raimondino,
or Mondino dei Luzzi, was descended from a
prominent Italian family. Little is known of his life. The
year of his birth is disputed; probably 1276 was near the
time. He was graduated in medicine in 1290 and in 1306
he became a professor in the University of Bologna, holding
his chair with credit until his death in 1326. Like
that of the illustrious Homer, Mondino&rsquo;s nativity has been
claimed by several rival cities. Guy de Chauliac, writing
in 1363, states that Mondino was a Bolognese: <i>Mundinus
Bononiensis</i> is Chauliac&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Mondino&rsquo;s method of teaching anatomy is known from
Chauliac&rsquo;s testimony:&mdash;&ldquo;Mundinus of Bologna, wrote on
anatomy, and my master, Bertruccius, demonstrated it
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
many times in this manner:&mdash;The body having been placed
on a table, he would make from it four readings; in the
first the digestive organs were treated, because more prone
to rapid decomposition; in the second, the organs of respiration;
in the third, the organs of circulation; in the fourth
the extremities were treated.&rdquo; The innovation so auspiciously
begun was not continued, and after the death of Mondino
human dissections were made only at long intervals.
The few instances in which, in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, the ecclesiastical and civil authorities granted
the right to make dissections only prove the contention,
that the practical study of human anatomy did not gain
recognition until the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>When Mondino began his dissections the epoch of
Saracen learning had ended, but the influence of Arab
medicine exerted by the writings of Albucasis, Avicenna
and Rhazes had not declined. The Arabian physicians
had accomplished little for anatomy. In this line the influence
of Galen was still potent, and was rarely questioned
until the publication of the <i>Fabrica</i> of Vesalius in 1543.
During a long period the little treatise of Mondino held
full sway in the mediaeval schools. Medicine was taught
in the University of Bologna, which as early as the twelfth
century was celebrated for its departments of literature and
of law. These studies were free of the difficulties which
beset medicine. The prejudice against dissection was so
great that for nearly a century after his death few men
dared to repeat the acts of Mondino.</p>
<p>In 1316 Mondino issued his book which remained in
manuscript form for more than one hundred and fifty
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
years, the first printed edition bearing the date 1478.
Small and imperfect as it was, it marks an era in the history
of science. By command of the authorities this book
was read in all the Italian Universities. The work of
Mondino contained no new facts; it was compiled largely
from the writings of Galen and of Avicenna. The descriptions,
to use the words of Turner, &ldquo;are corrupted by
the barbarous leaven of the Arabian schools, and his Latin
is defaced by the exotic nomenclature of Ibn-Sina and
Al-Rasi&rdquo;. Mondino divided the body into three cavities,
of which the upper contains the animal members, the
lower the natural members, and the middle the spiritual
members. Many of his names are borrowed from the
Arab writers. Thus, he calls the peritoneum <i>siphac</i>, the
omentum <i>zyrbi</i>, and the mesentery <i>eucharus</i>. His description
of the heart is much nearer accuracy than would
be expected. He resorted to vivisection, and tells us that
when the recurrent nerves of the larynx are cut the animal&rsquo;s
voice is lost. In his book we find the rudiments of
phrenology. He states that the brain is divided into compartments,
each of which holds one of the faculties of the
intellect.</p>

<p class="pcap">MONDINO&rsquo;S DIAGRAM OF THE HEART, 1513</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Mondino did not himself make the dissections which
are credited to him. According to an ancient custom
which lasted until the time of Vesalius, the actual cutting
was done by a barber who wielded a knife as large as a
cleaver. The professor of anatomy sat upon an elevated
seat and discoursed concerning the parts, while a demonstrator,
who also did not soil his fingers, pointed to the
different structures with a staff. Originally Mondino&rsquo;s
book contained no figures; when the art of wood engraving
was introduced in the latter part of the fifteenth century,
a few rude woodcuts appeared which represent
Mondino and his method of teaching. In the <i>Fasciculus
Medicinae</i> of Joannes de Ketham, published at Venice in
1493, Mondino&rsquo;s book is printed with an illustration
showing a demonstration in anatomy.</p>
<p>According to Mondino the heart is placed in the centre
of the body. The valves he considers &ldquo;wonderful
works of nature&rdquo;. He describes a right, left and middle
ventricle. The right ventricle has thinner walls than the
left, because it contains blood; the left one contains the
vital spirit, which passes through the arteries to the body;
and the middle ventricle consists of many small cavities
&ldquo;broader on the right side than on the left, to the end
that the blood, which comes to the left ventricle from the
right, be refined, because its refinement is the preparation
for the generation of vital spirit, which should be continually
formed&rdquo;. Mondino describes five bones of the head,
separated by three sutures&mdash;coronal, sagittal and occipital.
The brain has two membranes: dura and pia. There are
three cerebral ventricles&mdash;anterior, posterior and middle&mdash;and
in these he locates the various intellectual qualities.
He describes the cerebral nerves: olfactory, optic, motor
oculi, facial, vagus, trigeminal, auditory and hypoglossal.
He calls the innominate bone <i>os femoris</i>: the femur, <i>canna
coxae</i>; the humerus,
<i>os adjutori</i>; while
the bones of both leg
and forearm are named
<i>focilia</i> major and
minus.</p>

</div>
<p>Like many anatomists
who succeeded
him, Mondino mingled
surgical ideas
with his anatomical
statements. A break
in the <i>siphac</i> causes
hernia and a swelling
in the <i>mirach</i>.
He treated ascites by
puncture and evacuation,
making a
valve-like opening.
Wounds of the large
intestines must be
sutured; if the wound
be in the small intestines
he advises that
&ldquo;you should have large ants, and, making them bite
the conjoined lips of the wound, decapitate them instantly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
and continue until the lips remain in apposition and
then reduce the gut as before&rdquo;. He gives an explanation
of the length and convolution of the intestines; &ldquo;for if it
were not convoluted the animals would have to be continuously
ingesting food and continuously defecating, which
would impede engagement in the higher occupations&rdquo;.
Digestion is aided by black bile from the spleen and by
red bile from the liver. The kidneys he regards as glands
in which urine is extracted from the blood. The renal
veins expand and form a fine membrane like a sieve
through which the urine is filtered but blood cannot pass.
He mentions renal calculi: if small they pass through the
ureter; if large they are incurable except by incision, and
this is to be avoided. The uterus and breasts are connected
by veins, hence the sympathy between these organs.
Inguinal hernia is to be operated upon; the spermatic
cord and testicle may or may not be dissected out, or
the hernia may be treated by the application of a caustic.
An incision in the neck of the bladder will heal, because
this part is muscular; but a cut in the body of the organ
will not heal. He describes the operation for stone:&mdash;The
patient being in proper position, the stone is conducted
to the neck of the bladder by the finger in the rectum;
an incision is made and the stone is pulled out with an
instrument called <i>trajectorium</i>.</p>
<p>Mondino&rsquo;s book passed through not less than twenty-three
editions between the years 1478-1580. The only
manuscript extant is in the National Library at Paris.</p>
<p>The first printed edition of the <i>Anathomia Mundini</i>,
Pavia, 1478, is a folio of twenty-two leaves. The Strassburg
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
edition, 1513, is a small octavo volume of forty
leaves. It contains a diagram of the heart and an astrological
figure, a cadaver with the thorax and abdomen
opened, surrounded by the signs of the zodiac. Such
was the volume which for more than two hundred years
was supposed to contain
all that was to
be said of human
anatomy!</p>

<p>So numerous are
the abbreviations in
Mondino&rsquo;s book, so
barbarous is his style,
that the making of a
translation is a difficult
task. His reasons
for writing are
these:&mdash;&ldquo;A work upon
any science or art&mdash;as
saith Galen&mdash;is
issued for three reasons;
<i>First</i>, that one
may help his friends.
<i>Second</i>, that he may

powers. <i>Third</i>,
that he may be saved

</div>
<p>For two hundred years
anatomists used Mondino&rsquo;s book as a
text for their lectures and for the same
period anatomical writers did little
more than comment upon this treatise.
The new art of wood engraving was
turned to anatomical use and crude illustrations
of the various parts of the body were put into
circulation. Some of these pictures were in the form of
<i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i>, or flying leaves. A set of anatomical
plates of this type was issued by a certain Ricardus Hela,
a physician of Paris, as early as the year 1493. They were
printed at Nuremberg. Their character may be judged
by the accompanying illustration of the osseous system.</p>
<h3>Gabriel de Zerbi</h3>
<p>One of Mondino&rsquo;s commentators was Gabriel de Zerbi
(1468-1505), of Verona, who taught medicine, logic and
philosophy in the Universities of Padua, Bologna and
Rome. His book, <i>Anatomia Corporis Humani</i>, appeared
at Venice in 1502. Zerbi imitated Mondino in style,
abbreviations and language. The work, however, contains
some original observations regarding the Fallopian
tubes, the puncta lachrymalia and the lachrymal gland.
From the fact that Zerbi describes two lachrymal glands
in each orbit, it is known that many of his dissections
were made upon brutes.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Zerbi&rsquo;s reputation, which extended to all parts of Europe,
was the cause of his death. The Venetians received
from Constantinople the request for a skillful physician
who should treat one of the principal Seigniors of Turkey.
The Republic turned its eyes to Zerbi who went to Constantinople,
apparently cured the Seignior, and, loaded
with presents, started on the return voyage for Venice,
Unfortunately the patient suddenly died after a debauch.
The infuriated Turks overtook the ship on which Zerbi
and his son were passengers and carried them back to
Constantinople, where both the anatomist and his son
were quartered alive.</p>

book on medicine, <i>Spiegel der Artzny</i>, which was published
at Strassburg in 1518. It contains two anatomical
illustrations cut in wood, dated 1517, and supposedly made
after the drawings of Waechtlin, a pupil of the Elder
Holbein. These pictures tell their own story; they show
a marked improvement over the figures which Hundt
published in 1501. The other anatomical plate in Phryesen&rsquo;s

devoted to the Arab medical authors, Achillinus made
numerous discoveries which are set forth in his general
anatomy, <i>De Humani Corporis Anatomica</i>, Venice, 1516;

upon Mondino&rsquo;s
book, <i>In

credited to Wharton;

<p class="pcap">DISSECTION BY BERENGARIO, 1535</p>
</div>
<p>Giacomo Berengario, Jacobus Berengarius Carpensis,
also known as Carpus, was born in the small town of
Carpi, in the Duchy of Modena, in the year 1470. His
father, who was a surgeon, directed his studies, and for a
time he was placed under the instruction of the learned
Aldus Manutius. Graduating in medicine from the
University of Bologna, Berengario became noted for his
skill in surgery and anatomy. He taught these branches
in Pavia, and was a member of the Bologna faculty from
1502 to 1527. Then he practiced for a time in Rome,
where he amassed a fortune by the treatment of the victims
of syphilis. The last twenty years of his life were
spent in Ferrara, where he died in 1550. Berengario was
one of the restorers of anatomy. His first dissection is
said to have been made in the house of Albert Pion,
Seigneur de Carpi. This demonstration was given publicly
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
upon the body of a pig. Soon the anatomist turned
his attention to human subjects, of which it is said that
more than a hundred passed beneath his scalpel.</p>
<p>Berengario&rsquo;s later years are said by Brambilla to have
been made miserable by the machinations of the agents
of the Inquisition, who objected to some of his opinions
regarding the organs of generation. He was unjustly
accused of dissecting living men&mdash;an accusation which
arose from his statement that the surgeon should observe
the anatomy of the living body whenever it was opened
by wounds or accidents.</p>

<p class="pcap">SKELETON BY BERENGARIO, 1523</p>
</div>
<p>Berengario determined to improve Mondino&rsquo;s book
by making corrections in the
text, and by adding suitable
illustrations. No illustrations
were to be found in the
early editions of Mondino,
and those which were added
by later editors of the work
were untrue to nature. To
Berengario must be given the
credit of furnishing some of
the first anatomical illustrations
that were published,
and that were made from
actual human dissections.
These appeared in his &ldquo;Commentaries
of Carpus upon
the Anatomy of Mundinus&rdquo;,
(<i>Carpi Commentaria super</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
<i>Anatomia Mundini</i>), which was published at Bologna in
1521. The volume contains twenty-one plates which were
cut in wood. They have been credited to the celebrated
artist, Hugo da Carpi. While the drawing is somewhat
coarse, the illustrations are true to nature and show a distinct
advance over preceding pictures of this class. Berengario
states that his plates will be of value not only to
physicians and surgeons but also to artists (<i>et istae figurae
etiam juvant pictores in lineandis membris</i>). Some of
his figures are schematic; for example, those showing the
abdominal muscles. So much better are his illustrations
than those of his predecessors
that it may fairly be claimed
that Berengario was the
first author to produce an illustrated
anatomy.</p>

<p>Berengario also wrote a
&ldquo;Short Introduction to the
Anatomy of the Human
Body&rdquo;, <i>Isagogae Breves in
Anatomiam Humani Corporis</i>;
and a work on Fracture
of the Skull.</p>
<p>He was the first anatomist
who described the basilar
part of the occipital bone,
the sphenoidal sinus and the
tympanic membrane. Meryon<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>
credits him with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
&ldquo;first correct description of the great omentum (gastrocolic)
and transverse mesocolon; of the caecal appendix
vermiformis, of the valvulae conniventes of the intestines;
of the relative proportions
of the thorax and pelvis in
man and woman; of the
flexor-brevis-pollicis; of the
vesiculae seminales; of the
separate cartilages of the
larynx; of the membranous
pellicle in front of the

of the semilunar valves at

deviate from the Galenic teaching in regard to the structure
of the heart. He diplomatically states that in the human
subject the foramina in the cardiac septum are seen
only with great difficulty (<i>sed in homine cum maxima
difficultate videnter</i>).</p>

After obtaining proficiency
in mathematics and astronomy,
he went to Paris
where he studied medicine
for several years.
Returning to Germany,
he engaged in the study
of practical anatomy and
became a professor in
Marburg, in which city
he died in the year 1560.
He is said to have conducted
the first dissections
that were made in
Marburg, where he taught
anatomy for twenty-four years, or from 1536 to 1560.</p>

<p class="pcap">DRYANDER</p>
</div>
<p>Dryander, although he was a partisan of Mondino and
da Carpi, and was a fierce and sometimes an unfair opponent
of Vesalius, deserves to be regarded as one of the
restorers of anatomy. He made several observations upon
the distinction between the cortical and the medullary
portions of the brain; and was one of the earliest practical
anatomists of the sixteenth century to furnish anatomical
illustrations. He made important astronomical observations
and was the inventor of several useful instruments.
He was the author of three medical works of
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
which two were upon anatomy. His <i>Anatomia Mundini</i>,
which was published at Marburg in 1541, contains forty-six
plates, many of which have been copied from Berengario&rsquo;s
work.</p>

<p>Charles Estienne, better known by the name of <i>Carolus
Stephanus</i>, was a French anatomist whose work is
worthy of remembrance. Born in the early part of the
sixteenth century, he was given an excellent education.
He belonged to a noted Huguenot family of scholars and
printers who have made the Estienne name famous.
Robert Estienne, the brother of Charles, became the victim
of religious persecution; he was obliged to flee to
save his life, and for a time the publishing business was
conducted by Charles Estienne. The latter also suffered
for his faith; he was thrown into a dungeon, where he
died in the year 1564. Charles Estienne wrote numerous
books on literature, history, forestry and botany. His
anatomical treatise, <i>De Dissectione Partium Corporis
Humani</i>, appeared at Paris in 1545 with sixty-two full
page plates which combine anatomical clearness, beauty
of form, and artistic representation. A French translation
of Estienne&rsquo;s Anatomy was published in 1546. This
work was printed as far as the middle of the third book
as early as the year 1539: some of the plates are dated as
early as 1530. The illustrations have been excellently cut
in wood; many of them show the entire body, with much
ornamentation, so that the proper anatomical part seems
small and irrelevant. Some of the plates show the subject
in picturesque and even loathsome attitudes. The text of
this work is especially valuable for the history of anatomical
discovery. Although he was an ardent Galenist,
Estienne made numerous original observations in anatomy.
He described the synovial glands, a discovery which has
been credited to Clopton Havers. Estienne was the first
anatomist to discover the canal in the spinal cord; he described
the capsule of the liver, a tissue which bears
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Glisson&rsquo;s name; and differentiated the eight pair from the
sympathetic nerves. He was the first anatomist to see and
describe the valves in the veins, which he called <i>apophyses
venarum</i>&mdash; discovery which has been claimed for
Jacobus Sylvius, Cannanus, Amatus and Fabricius.</p>
<p>The question of priority in the discovery of the valves
of the veins gave rise to much controversy. It is reasonable
to assume that these structures were noticed independently
by all of the anatomists whose names are mentioned
above.</p>

<br />Vesalius&rsquo;s Early Life</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_p052.jpg" alt="Illuminated capital" width="150" height="149" />
</div>
<p>Andreas Vesalius, or Wesalius
as the family name was inscribed prior
to the year 1537, was born in Brussels
on the last day of the year 1514. From
astrological observations made by
Jerome Cardan we learn that this event
occurred about six o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, and under favorable stellar auspices. The placenta
and caul, to which popular belief ascribed remarkable
powers, were carefully preserved by the mother.</p>
<p>The Vesalius family originally was named Witing,
(<i>Witting</i>, <i>Wytinck</i>, <i>Wytings</i>, according to various authorities)
and adopted the name Wesalius from the town of
Wesel, (<i>Wesele</i>, <i>Vesel</i>), in the Duchy of Cleves, which the
family claimed as their native place. The three weasels
(<i>Flemish</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Wesel&rdquo;), found in the Vesalian coat of arms,
testify to this origin.</p>
<p>It may be said with truth that medical learning ran in
the blood of the Vesalius family. Andreas&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather,
Peter Wesalius, wrote a treatise on some of
the works of Avicenna and at great cost restored the manuscripts
of several medical authors. Peter&rsquo;s son, John
Wesalius, held the responsible position of physician to
Mary of Burgundy, the first wife of Maximilian the First;
in his old age John taught medicine in the University of
Louvain. From that time the Vesalius family was closely
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
associated with the Austro-Burgundian dynasty. Eberhard,
son of John Wesalius, served as physician to Mary
of Burgundy; he died before attaining his thirty-sixth
year, and was long survived by his father. Eberhard,
who was the grandfather of Andreas, wrote commentaries
upon the books of Rhazes and on the <i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates.
He was also noted as a mathematician. Eberhard&rsquo;s
son Andreas, the father of the anatomist, was
apothecary to Charles the Fifth and to Margaret of
Austria. He accompanied the great Emperor upon his
numerous journeys and military expeditions. In 1538
he presented Andreas&rsquo;s first anatomical plates to the
Emperor, and thus opened the way to the court to his son.
The father remained in the imperial service until the day
of his death, which occurred in 1546. Andreas&rsquo;s mother,
Isabella Crabbe, exercised a great influence upon the
youth whom she believed to be destined to accomplish
great things. She it was who preserved the manuscripts
and books of the Vesalian ancestors. Isabella happily
lived long enough to see the <i>Fabrica</i>, to witness the intellectual
triumph of her son, and to know of his activity
at the Spanish court.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE OLD UNIVERSITY OF LOUVAIN
<br />(Erected early in the Fourteenth Century. The New Building dates from 1680)</p>
</div>
<p>Little is known of the youth of Vesalius. The traditions
of his ancestors, their accomplishments in the field of
letters and in medicine, and their loyalty to their sovereigns,
were themes which his mother must have recounted with
pleasure. At an early age Andreas was sent to the neighboring
city of Louvain, whose University, founded in the
year 1424, in the early part of the sixteenth century
eclipsed many institutions of greater age, and in the number
of its students ranked second only to the University
of Paris. The theologians of Louvain were noted for
their orthodox Catholicism; from the very first days of
religious controversy they had battled strongly against the
rising tide of the Reformation. Her professors of jurisprudence
and of philosophy were men of eminent talents.
Within the University were four literary schools which
were named <i>Paedagogium Castri</i>, <i>Porci</i>, <i>Lilii</i>, and <i>Falconis</i>,
from their insignia:&mdash;a fort, a pig, a lily, and a falcon.
Here also was the <i>Collegium trilingue Buslidianum</i>,
which was founded by Hieronymus Busleiden (+1517)
for teaching the Greek, Hebrew and Latin languages.
Vesalius selected the <i>Paedagogium Castri</i> which he
fondly mentions in laudatory terms in his <i>Fabrica</i>. Here,
and in the Busleidinian College, he obtained that thorough
knowledge of ancient languages which, in later years, astonished
his hearers and served him well in numerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
literary controversies. The names of Vesalius&rsquo;s teachers
are unknown, although Adam<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> states that John Winter of
Andernach was his professor of Greek. Vesalius speaks
scornfully of one of his teachers, a theologian, who, in
trying to explain Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>De Anima</i>, used a picture of
the <i>Margarita Philosophica</i> to show the structure of
the brain. Among Vesalius&rsquo;s school companions were
Gisbertus Carbo, to whom the anatomist presented the
first skeleton which he articulated (<i>Fabrica</i>, 1543, page 162);
and the younger Granvella, who later was Chancellor to
Charles the Fifth.</p>
<p>At an early age Vesalius possessed a desire to study
the structure of the human body. His powers of observation
were precociously developed. When a boy, learning
to swim by the aid of bladders filled with air, he noted
the elasticity of these organs, and he referred to the incident
in his <i>Fabrica</i> (1543, page 518). When little more
than a child, he tired of dialectics and tried to learn anatomy
from the scholastic writings of Albertus Magnus and
of Michael Scotus. He soon discovered that the true
road to anatomical science led, not through books but
through the actual handling of the dead tissues. He began
the practical study of anatomy by dissecting the
bodies of mice, moles, rats, dogs and cats.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>

<br />Sojourn in Paris</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_p056.jpg" alt="Illuminated capital" width="150" height="154" />
</div>
<p>One thought was uppermost
in the mind of Vesalius, and that was
to follow the profession of his ancestors,
just as in ancient Greece the
sons of the Asclepiadae naturally
adopted the vocation of their fathers.
Andreas possessed an excellent preliminary
education and was especially proficient in the
Greek and Latin languages; he also knew something of
Hebrew and much of Arabic. It was in the year 1533
that the young Belgian travelled to Paris for the purpose
of obtaining a medical education. At that time the
French capital was the Mecca of the medical world&mdash;Paris,
that city where classical medicine first secured support
(<i>ubi primum medicinam prospere renasci vidimus</i>)<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>.
In Paris, under the leadership of Budaeus, Humanism
had enjoyed a rapid growth; and here Petrus Brissotus,
after gaining the doctor&rsquo;s cap in the year 1514, produced
a revolution by delivering his lectures from the books of
Galen in place of the treatises of Averr&ouml;es and of Avicenna.
At his own expense Brissotus published Leonicenus&rsquo;s
translation of Galen&rsquo;s <i>Ars Curativa</i>, in order that his
pupils might not be misled by the incorrect text of the
Arab authors. It will be recalled that, long before this
time, classical Greek and Latin medical literature had
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
passed through the distorting crucible of Saracenic
translations. At this period medical science, purified
from Arabic dross, was taught in a splendid manner in
Paris by such eminent professors as Jacobus Sylvius, Jean
Fernel, and Winter of Andernach. At their feet sat
young men from the remotest parts of Europe.</p>
<p>The most popular of the Paris teachers was Jacobus
Sylvius, or Jacques Dubois, whose Latinized name is
perpetuated in anatomical nomenclature. He was born
at Louville, near Amiens, in 1478. In his early years he
was noted for his scholarly attainments in the Greek, Latin
and Hebrew languages and was the author of a
French grammar. His anatomical knowledge was gained
under Jean Tagault, a famous Parisian practitioner
and surgical author.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p_p057.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="679" />
<p class="pcap">SYLVIUS</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvius was noted for his industry,
for his eloquence, and above
all for his avarice. It was the inordinate
desire for money which
led him to abandon philology for
medicine. While studying under
Tagault he began a course of medical
lectures, explanatory of the
works of Hippocrates and Galen,
with such success that the Faculty
of the University of Paris protested
on the score that Sylvius was not a
graduate. He then went to Montpellier, whose medical
professors had long held a high position, where, according
to Astruc, he received the doctor&rsquo;s cap at the end of
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
November, 1529. He was then above fifty years of age.
Armed with this degree, he returned to Paris and immediately
entered the lists as an independent medical teacher,
but was again halted by the Faculty who ruled that he
must first receive the Bachelor&rsquo;s degree. This he gained
on June 28, 1531. Sylvius then resumed his lectures with
such success that his classes in the Coll&eacute;ge de Tr&eacute;guier
numbered from four to five hundred, while Fernel, who
was a professor in the Coll&eacute;ge de Cornouailles, lectured
to almost empty benches. In 1550, Henry the Second
named Sylvius Professor of Medicine, as the successor of
Vidus Vidius, in the recently established Coll&eacute;ge de
France. Sylvius died January 13, 1555, and was interred
in the paupers&rsquo; cemetery as he had wished.</p>
<p>Sylvius was not only an eloquent lecturer but he was
also a demonstrative teacher. He was the first professor
in France who taught anatomy from the human cadaver.
In his lectures on botany he used a collection of plants to
elucidate the subject. His chief fault was a blind reverence
for ancient authors. He regarded Galen&rsquo;s writings
as gospel; if the cadaver presented structures unlike Galen&rsquo;s
description, the fault was not in the book but in the
dead body, or, perchance, human structure had changed
since Galen&rsquo;s time! In one of his early books<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>, Sylvius
declared that Galen&rsquo;s anatomy was infallible; that Galen&rsquo;s
treatise, <i>De Usu Partium</i>, was divine; and that
further progress was impossible!</p>
<p>The character of Sylvius was contemptible. He was
a man of vast learning and at the same time was rough,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
coarse and brutal. His avarice led him to endure the
cold winters of Paris without the benefit of a fire; in severe
weather he would play at football, or engage in other
violent exercise in his room, to save the cost of fuel.
Once, and once only, did his friends find him hilarious;
they wondered and asked the cause. Sylvius said he was
happy because he had dismissed his &ldquo;three beasts, his
mule, his cat and his maid&rdquo;. He was notoriously rigid
in exacting his fees from students, and on one occasion
he threatened to stop his lectures until two delinquents
should pay their dues. Although he was supposed to
have amassed great wealth, little of it was found after
his death, and these sums were secreted in secluded
places. In 1616, when his former residence in the <i>rue
Saint-Jacques</i> was demolished, numerous gold pieces
were found. His reputation for miserliness followed
him beyond the grave, as witness his epitaph:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="f">Sylbius hic situs est, gratis qui nil dedit unqu&agrave;m,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="f">Mortuus et gratis quod legis ista dolet.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sylvius lies here, who never gave anything for nothing:</p>
<p class="t0">Being dead, he even grieves that you read these lines for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In controversies he was violent and vindictive&mdash;a
pastmaster in the use of bitter language. Jealous of the
fame of other anatomists, he was particularly enraged
when, in later years, he was opposed by Vesalius. Sylvius
spoke of him not as Vesalius, but as <i>Vesanus</i>, a madman,
who poisoned Europe by his impiety and clouded knowledge
by his blunders. Such was the man who, in the
mid-part of the sixteenth century, filled the position of
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
highest honor in the Medical Faculty of the Coll&eacute;ge
de France<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Sylvius rendered valuable service in naming the muscles
which, prior to his time, were designated by numbers.
These, says Northcote<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> &ldquo;were differently applied by almost
every author; so that it was the description, and not
the name, that must lead one to know what part was
meant by such authors; and this required a previous
thorough knowledge of anatomy&rdquo;. He is the first writer
who mentions colored injections and is supposed to have
discovered this useful adjunct of anatomical study. He
was the first anatomist who published satisfactory descriptions
of the pterygoid and clinoid processes of the
sphenoid bone, and of the os unguis. He gave a good
account of the sphenoidal sinus in the adult but denied
its existence in the child, as had been affirmed by Fallopius<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>.
Sylvius also wrote intelligently concerning the
vertebrae but incorrectly described the sternum. His
observation concerning the valves in the veins gave rise
to much discussion; the honor of priority in the discovery,
however, belongs to other anatomists&mdash;Estienne and
Cannanus. His discoveries in cerebral anatomy have
caused his name to be attached to the <i>aqueduct</i>, the <i>fissure</i>
and the <i>artery of Sylvius</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The manner in which Sylvius conducted his anatomical
course is known to us by his own writings, by the
testimony of Moreau<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>, and by that of Vesalius<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>. Thus the
course for the year 1535 began with the reading, by
Sylvius, of Galen&rsquo;s treatise <i>De Usu Partium</i>. When the
middle of the first book was reached, Sylvius remarked
that the subject was too difficult for his students to understand
and that he would not plague his class with it.
He then jumped to the fourth book, read all to the tenth
book, discussed a part of the tenth and omitting the
eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth, he took up the fourteenth
and the remaining three books. Thus he omitted all that
Galen had said concerning the extremities. A second
Galenic work which Sylvius used was the anatomico-physiologic
treatise, <i>De Musculorum Motu</i>. Not infrequently
the professor was unable to demonstrate in dissection
the parts on which he had lectured. Thus, on
one occasion, the students succeeded in finding the pulmonary
and aortic valves which Sylvius had failed to find
on the preceding day.</p>
<h3>Joannes Guinterius of Andernach</h3>
<p>Another famous member of the Paris Faculty of this
period, and a man whose life-story reads like a romance,
was Joannes Guinterius, the beggar of Deventer. Guinterius
(Gonthier, Guinther, Guinter, Winter, or Winther),
who is often called John Winter of Andernach, from the
name of the town in which he was born, lived between
the years 1487-1574, and rose to eminence in both the literary
and the medical worlds. Born of humble parents, he
was sent at an early age to the University of Utrecht. Leaving
this institution because of his poverty, he went to
Deventer where he was reduced to the necessity of begging
in the streets. He drifted to the University of
Marburg, and here displayed such brilliant talents that he
soon obtained employment as a teacher in the small town
of Goslar, in Brunswick. His growing reputation for
learning led to his appointment to the chair of Greek in
the noted University of Louvain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>

<p class="pcap">WINTER OF ANDERNACH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Desiring to study medicine, Guinterius went to Paris
in 1525; he received the Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1528, and
the full medical title two years later. He passed a brilliant
examination which won for him the commendation
of the most eminent professors. Remaining in Paris, he
engaged in practice and in teaching, and rapidly rose to
eminence. In addition to conducting courses in anatomy,
he translated into Latin the writings of the most noted
Greek medical authors of antiquity&mdash;the books of Galen,
of Oribasius, of Paul of Aegina, of Caelius Aurelianus,
and of Alexander of Tralles&mdash;all of which were held in
high esteem in the sixteenth century. His fame reached
far beyond the boundaries of France. Christian III., the
enlightened king of Denmark, who was noted for his love
of literature, sought to attach him to the Danish court,
but the honor was refused. Having become a convert to
the religious views of Luther, Guinterius found that his
life was in danger; he left Paris and resided for a time in
Metz. He soon removed to Strassburg, where he was
received with distinguished honors and was appointed to
a professorship in the University. Owing to the activity
of his enemies, his position became insecure; accordingly,
he resigned his chair and spent a considerable time in
travelling throughout Germany and Italy. In the year
1562, Ferdinand I., in appreciation of the great merits of
Guinterius, raised him to the highest distinction by placing
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
him among the nobles of the land; and thus the beggar
of Deventer became a nobleman of Strassburg. His
life ended October 4, 1574.</p>
<p>Like Sylvius, Guinterius was a teacher of men who became
greater than himself&mdash;Vesalius, Servetus and Rondelet
sat upon his benches. Like Sylvius, he placed his
faith in Galen and failed to grasp the great truth that
anatomical science is based, not on the writings of the
Fathers but on dissection of the dead body.</p>
<h3>Jean Fernel</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p_p064.jpg" alt="" width="631" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">JEAN FERNEL</p>
</div>
<p>The third bright star of the Paris constellation was
Jean Fernel (1485-1558), of Amiens, who was regarded as
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
the ablest physiologist of his time and was physician-in-ordinary
to Henry the Second. Fernel dipped deeply
into philosophy, geometry and mathematics. Before
entering the medical profession he issued three books on
mathematic and geometric subjects. He received the
medical degree in 1530, but continued his study of mathematics
with such ardor that he was almost ruined financially.
On the advice of his friends he entered upon the
practice of medicine in Paris and met with remarkable
success. He was skilled in anatomy and surgery and accompanied
his sovereign upon numerous military expeditions.
His medical writings are contained in many
volumes and concern a variety of subjects, such as physiology,
therapeutics, surgery, pathology, the treatment of
fevers and the venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Fernel&rsquo;s medical views were powerfully influenced by
the teachings of an unfortunate French philosopher, Pierre
de la Rame&eacute;, or Ramus, who, like many other Protestants,
lost his life on Saint Bartholomew&rsquo;s Night. Brutally assassinated,
his body was dragged through the streets of
Paris and then was thrown into the Seine; but his system
of philosophy survived and exercised a potent influence
until it was eclipsed by the doctrines of Descartes.</p>
<p>Ramus, who was an uncompromising opponent of the
Aristotelian philosophy, pointed out the defects and suggested
the reforms in the system of University education.
He compared the teaching of medicine with that of theology,
much to the disparagement of the latter:&mdash;&ldquo;The
reason&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;why medicine is better taught, and the
lectures are better attended than in theology is, that those
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
who teach it know it, and practice it, and their disputations
are chiefly on the books of Hippocrates and Galen;
whilst the theologians observe a strict reticence on questions
of the Old Testament, which they read in Hebrew,
as well as of the New, which they read in Greek, but
display their learning in subtle questions respecting the
pagan philosophy of Plato and Aristotle&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> Ramus endeavored
to withdraw the minds of both physicians and
medical students from the authoritative dogmas of the
ancient physicians and to substitute therefor the intelligent
study of Nature.
The practical trend of
his mind is shown in his
suggestion that institutions
should be arranged
for clinical teaching.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p_p066.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">RAMUS</p>
</div>
<p>Just as Ramus had
become an Eclectic in
philosophy, so Fernel
sought the best from
various sources and different
medical systems.
Like Ramus, he cast
off the yoke which authority
had placed upon
him; and proposed
carefully planned principles
which should lead to the discovery of truth. Like
Ramus, Fernel presented his views in a clear style and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
better order than was to be found in the writings of his
predecessors. Like Ramus, he adopted the good and rejected
the bad, regardless of whether it had been said by
Aristotle, or by Galen, or by Hippocrates. Fernel was a
reformer who stood for freedom of thought, which, up to
his time, had suffered from the despotism of the scholastics.
Although many of Fernel&rsquo;s physiologic and pathologic
ideas seem ridiculous when viewed in the light of
modern knowledge, yet he deserves praise for daring to
oppose ancient dogmas, and for pointing the road to progress.
In breadth of view, Fernel was far superior to
Sylvius and Guinterius.</p>
<p>The anatomical teaching in Paris in the early part of
the sixteenth century was far from satisfactory. There
was too much lecturing and theorizing from Galen&rsquo;s texts,
and too little of actual dissection. Vesalius, who was not
backward in his criticisms, says that the dissections were
made by ignorant barbers, and during the whole time
that he was in Paris he never saw Guinterius use a knife
upon a cadaver. Only at rare intervals was a human
body brought into the amphitheatre, and then the dissection
lasted less than three days. It comprised only a
superficial study of the intestines and abdominal muscles;
no other muscles were studied. The bones, veins, arteries
and nerves were almost wholly ignored. The great
lights of the Paris profession were totally unfit to give to
the young Belgian what was his heart&rsquo;s desire. They
were ignorant and knew it not. It is not surprising that,
on more than one occasion, Vesalius brushed the ignorant
prosectors aside, took the knife into his own hands,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
and carried out the dissection in a systematic manner.
His zeal and learning won the admiration of Guinterius
who spoke of Vesalius and Servetus in loving terms;&mdash;&ldquo;first
Andreas Vesalius, a young man, by Hercules! of
singular zeal in the study of anatomy; and second,
Michael Villanovanus (Servetus), deeply imbued with
learning of every kind, and behind none in his knowledge
of the Galenic doctrine. With the aid of these two, I
have examined the muscles, veins, arteries and nerves of
the whole body, and demonstrated them to the students&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Vesalius must have had many blue days in Paris&mdash;days
when he longed to have a free hand in dissection. A
weaker character than his would have fitted peacefully
into the established order of things, but not of such stuff
was Andreas made. The difficulties which beset his path
only stimulated him to work the harder; he firmly resolved
to devote his energy, his talents and his life to
anatomical study and teaching. He decided to secure
the opportunity to dissect the human body and to rival
the ancient Alexandrian professors who taught the subject.
&ldquo;Never&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;would I have been able to accomplish
my purpose in Paris, if I had not taken the
work into my own hands&rdquo;. The Book of Nature which
Sylvius lauded, but kept his pupils from studying, was
now opened by Vesalius. He dissected numerous dogs
and studied the only part of human anatomy that was
available, namely, the bones. In his search for materials
for a skeleton he haunted the Cemetery of the Innocents.
On one occasion, when he went to Montfau&ccedil;on, the place
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
where the bodies of executed criminals were deposited and
bones were plentiful, Vesalius and his fellow-student were
attacked by fierce dogs. For a time the young anatomist
was in danger of leaving his own bones to the hungry
scavengers. By such dangers he gained what the Paris
professors could not supply. He became a master of the
osseous system, so much so that, when blindfolded, he
was able to name and describe any part of the skeleton
which was placed in his hands. His talents were recognized
by both professors and students; and at the third
anatomy which he attended in Paris he was requested to
take charge of the dissection. To the satisfaction of the
students, as well as to the astonishment of the barbers,
he made an elaborate dissection of the abdominal organs
and of the muscles of the arm.</p>

<br />Vesalius Returns to Louvain</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_p070.jpg" alt="Illuminated capital" width="150" height="153" />
</div>
<p>In the latter part of the
year 1536, owing to the outbreak of
the third Franco-German war, Vesalius
returned to the University of Louvain.
During this period he secured a human
skeleton by secret means. Accompanied
by his faithful friend, Regnier
Gemma, known as a mathematician as well as a
physician, Vesalius visited the gallows outside the walls
of Louvain in order to search for bones. Here he found
a skeleton which was held together simply by the ligaments
and still possessed the origins and insertions of the
muscles. Morley states that the body was that of &ldquo;a noted
robber, who, since he deserved more than ordinary
hanging, had been chained to the top of a high stake and
roasted alive. He had been roasted by a slow fire made
of straw, that was kept burning at some distance below
his feet. In that way there had been a dish cooked for
the fowls of heaven, which was regarded by them as a
special dainty. The sweet flesh of the delicately roasted
thief they had preferred to any other; his bones, therefore,
had been elaborately picked and there was left suspended
on the stake a skeleton dissected out and cleaned
by many beaks with rare precision. The dazzling skeleton,
complete and clean, was lifted up on high before the
eyes of the anatomist, who had been striving hitherto to
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
piece together such a thing out of the bones of many
people, gathered as occasion offered&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a prize could not be lost. With Gemma&rsquo;s assistance
Vesalius climbed the gallows and secured the skeleton
which he secretly conveyed to his home. The treasure,
however, was not complete; one finger, a patella and
a foot were missing. To this extent was Vesalius the
owner of a human skeleton. In supplying the missing
parts Vesalius was obliged to incur new dangers. He
stole out of the city in the nighttime, climbed the gallows
unaided, searched through the mass of decaying bodies,
and, having found the coveted bones, he stole into the
city by another gate. These secret expeditions, however,
soon became unnecessary, for the Burgomaster of Louvain
generously furnished an abundance of material for
Vesalius&rsquo;s students.</p>
<p>It was at this period&mdash;late in the year 1536 or early in
1537&mdash;that Vesalius conducted the first public anatomy
that had been held in Louvain in eighteen years. He
performed the dissection and lectured at the same time,
which was an innovation. Some remarks he made concerning
the seat of the soul caused him to be critised by
the theologians. A further cause for suspicion was his
association with such firm Protestants as Guinterius and
Sturm of Paris; and his friendly relations with the publisher
Rescius, and the physician Velsius. Fortunately
the suspicion of heresy did not lead to any formal charges,
but the affair seems to have rankled in his memory and
some years later, in his <i>Fabrica</i>, he sought to clear his
name of even the appearance of heresy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Vesalius began his career as an author by issuing a
paraphrase, or free translation, of the ninth book of the
<i>Almansor</i> of the celebrated Rhazes<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>. This book, <i>liber
ad Almansorem</i>, or work dedicated to the Caliph Al-Mans&ucirc;r,
was written by a learned Arab physician who
lived between the years 860-932. The <i>Almansor</i> consists
of ten books and was designed by the author for a complete
body or compendium of Physic. The first book
treats of anatomy and physiology; the second, of temperaments;
the third, of food and simple medicines; the
fourth, of means for preserving health; the fifth, of skin
diseases and cosmetics; the sixth, of diet; the seventh, of
surgery; the eighth, of poisons; the ninth, of treatment
of all parts of the body; the tenth, or last book, deals with
the treatment of fevers. The ninth book, which Vesalius
translated from the barbarous version into a readable
form, was so highly prized in mediaeval times that it
was read publicly in the schools and was commentated by
learned professors for more than a hundred years. By
this publication Vesalius furnished a valuable contribution
to medical literature. The numerous marginal and interlinear
notes, which he supplied, show his intimate acquaintance
with classical literature as well as with materia medica.
Vesalius emphasizes the fact that the book of Rhazes
contains many remedies which were unknown to the
Greeks. The value of his edition was increased by the
presence of original drawings of the plants mentioned
in the text.</p>

<br />Professor of Anatomy in Padua</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_p073.jpg" alt="Illuminated capital" width="150" height="141" />
</div>
<p>Shortly after the publication
of his <i>Paraphrasis in nonum librum
Rhazae</i>, Vesalius journeyed into Italy.
It was in the year 1537 that he entered
the prosperous and enlightened city of
Venice. Here the study of anatomy
not only was not tabooed, but was encouraged, particularly
by the Theatin monks who devoted themselves to the
care of the sick. At the head of this order stood two
remarkable men: J. Peter Caraffa, who later ascended
the papal throne as Paul IV.; and Ignatius Loyola, the
founder of the Jesuits. It is a strange circumstance that
two strong characters so dissimilar as were Vesalius and
Loyola should meet as co-workers in the same field.
The one was filled with a thirst for anatomical knowledge,
and was dreaming of the day when his <i>opus magnum</i>
should revolutionize an important science; the other was
enthused with visions of the world-wide acceptance of
the doctrines of Catholicism. They met again, in 1543&mdash;the
year which marks two important events, namely, the
publication of the <i>Fabrica</i>, and the full recognition of the
Jesuits by the Pope.</p>
<p>In Venice the young anatomist entered into various
lines of activity. He experimented with a new remedy,
the China root, and besought his acquaintances to observe
its effects in cases of pleurisy. He solicited anatomical
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
material and possibly may have conducted a public demonstration
in anatomy, although this is uncertain. He
practiced minor surgery; he leeched and opened veins,
particularly the popliteal vein which the barbers of that
day did not venture to touch. In Venice he fortunately
met his countryman, Jan Stephan van Calcar, who was
soon to furnish the drawings for Vesalius&rsquo;s first anatomical
plates.</p>

<p class="pcap">INSTRUMENTS USED IN DISSECTION
<br />(From the &ldquo;Fabrica&rdquo;, 1543)</p>
</div>
<p>In order to gain all the rights and privileges of a full-fledged
physician, Vesalius settled in Padua. On the 6th
day of December, 1537, shortly after having received his
degree as Doctor of Medicine, Andreas Vesalius of Brussels
was appointed Professor of Surgery with the right to
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
teach Anatomy in the famous University of Padua. This,
says Fisher, &ldquo;was the first purely anatomical chair ever
instituted&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From his own writings and from the manuscript notes
of his loyal student, Vitus Tritonius, a fairly good idea
of Vesalius&rsquo;s teaching can be given. The first act of the
young Paduan professor was to improve the course in
anatomy. Here, as he had done previously at Louvain,
Vesalius discharged the entire duties of the professorship.
He acted as lecturer, demonstrator and dissector. Dissatisfied
with the ignorant barbers, he ignored them and
employed his students as assistants. He resorted to all
possible means to obtain anatomical material, much of
which was secured by stealth.</p>
<p>The aula in which Vesalius conducted his course was
built of wood and was capable of holding five hundred
persons. In the centre of the room was a table under
which was a receptacle containing bones and joints. An
articulated skeleton was placed in an upright position at
one end of the table. In this elegantly appointed room,
before an audience of distinguished laymen and students,
the instruction in anatomy was given. The course was a
strenuous one, occupying practically the entire day for a
period of three weeks, and comprising not only human
but also much comparative anatomy. The vivisection of
dogs, pigs, and rarely of cats, was a regular part of the
course. Drawings were used to elucidate the relations
between the skeleton and the soft parts; and frequently
Vesalius marked the outlines of the joints upon the skin
of the subject. He also marked the cranial sutures with
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
ink. His anatomical charts were the work of his own
hand; at times he drew the pictures in the presence of
his audience. His dissections were made with extreme
neatness and dexterity. He used but few instruments and
these were of the simplest kind: knives of different shapes,
hooks, cannula, catheter, sounds, bristles, hammer, saw,
needles, thread and a sponge. Forceps and injection apparatus
were not used; he rarely used scissors. Much of
the actual separation of tissues was done by the aid of the
finger-nails. A vivisection board completed the list <i>de
instrumentis quae anatomes studioso debent esse ad
manum</i>.</p>
<p>Let us now follow one Vesalius&rsquo;s public courses in anatomy.
It is the month of December, in the year 1537. The
report has spread that the young Belgian professor will
begin his course. Long before the hour set for the lecture,
every available seat has been taken and many persons
are standing. An audience comprising the professors of
the University, the students of medicine, officials of the
city of Padua, and learned persons of all ranks, including
members of the clergy, numbering more than five hundred
persons, has assembled to do honor to the professor
of anatomy.</p>
<p>Vesalius comes into the arena and walks to the table
which is closely surrounded by his auditors. He wastes
no time; after a few preliminary remarks on the importance
of anatomy and the methods of acquiring a knowledge
of this science, he launches into the practical demonstration.
After rapidly pointing out the divisions of
the body, and demonstrating the skin, joints, cartilages,
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
ligaments, glands, fat and muscles, he passes to the more
complex parts, all of which are shown upon the skinned
body of a dog or of a lamb, in order to conserve the human
material. Now the human cadaver is placed on the
table; all eyes are turned upon it, for such a demonstration
occurs only at long intervals. Vesalius speaks first
of the difference in the structure of joints at different ages
and in different sexes, illustrating his remarks by means
of drawings and by an abundant supply of bones of man
and of the lower animals.</p>
<p>Now comes the dissection. This is made rapidly and
in regular order. Its course depends upon the amount of
material at hand; if the professor resorts to two bodies,
as in the year 1538, the demonstration is handled in grand
style. Vesalius uses the first body for a comprehensive
examination of the muscles, ligaments and viscera; whilst
the second cadaver is devoted to the relations of the veins,
arteries, nerves and viscera. The text of the <i>Fabrica</i> is
written according to this plan of public dissection.</p>
<p>At times Vesalius attempted to teach the whole of
anatomy on one cadaver. In this event, osteology was followed
by the dissection of the abdominal muscles layer
by layer, the demonstration closing with an examination
of the entire contents of the abdomen. The pelvic organs
were reached by incision and separation of the symphysis
pubis. If the cadaver was that of a female, the dissection
began with the mammary glands and then passed to the
inferior venter. In pregnancy the foetal membranes
were removed intact, and were placed in a vessel filled
with water. The foetus was opened and its anastomosing
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
vessels were found. For demonstrating the cotyledons,
the uterus of a sheep or goat was used. After the thorax
had been raised by means of a log or brick, Vesalius
passed to the face and the anterior part of the neck, freely
exposing the muscles on one side and the vessels and
nerves on the other. Then followed the unilateral preparation
of the muscles of the shoulder and back, then those
of the mouth, which were approached by means of division
of the lower jaw; and, finally, the pharynx and the
larynx were exposed. The rectus anticus muscle was
next brought into view, whereupon Vesalius detached the
head from the vertebral column. Decapitation was followed
by an examination of the cranium; the skull-cap
was sawed and the brain was dissected in its natural position.
Then came the examination of the eye, which
Vesalius dissected in two ways: either by a complete section,
or layer by layer from without inwards.</p>
<p>The ear and the cavities of the frontal and sphenoidal
bones were next opened, provided these bones were not
needed for the setting up of a skeleton. Finally he took
up the extremities, demonstrating the muscles of an arm
and a leg on one side, and the nerves and vessels on the
other. The anatomy lesson ended with the introduction
of numerous vivisections.</p>
<p>Vesalius could not entirely escape disputations, but he
gave to them a close anatomic basis. Theoretical physiology
was repugnant to him; for him physiology was
not speculation but the sequel of anatomic research. If
he at times gave free reign to his views, he indicated them
as mere theories. He did not ignore pathologic conditions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
but he handled them as briefly as possible. Fearing to
tire his audience with too much variety, he confined his
students closely to the structure of the human body.</p>
<p>The merit of Vesalius&rsquo;s public dissections, and the impression
which they made upon his auditors, can be appreciated
only by comparison with similar demonstrations
made by his predecessors. The large and enlightened
audience remained day by day for a period of three or
four weeks. He says not a word about the physical and
mental strain incident to such a strenuous course, in
which his entire time was employed. The courses
brought great financial profit to the professor.</p>
<p>On two occasions, probably in the years 1539 and
1540, Vesalius was called from Padua to Bologna to conduct
public dissections. This was a great honor, for
Bologna was the city in which Mondino had revived
the practical teaching of anatomy. These courses were
conducted by Vesalius in a wooden building erected for
that particular purpose. Here, as in Padua, the professor
acted as demonstrator and lecturer, remaining in this
ancient city for a period of several weeks. On the first
occasion he was supplied with three human bodies and
was enabled to handle the subject in grand style. At the
first s&eacute;ance he engaged with the celebrated Professor
Matthaeus Curtius, whose acquaintance he had made in
1538 while on a vacation trip, in a deep study of the question
of venesection. Before a large and select assembly
he demonstrated in all three bodies that Galen&rsquo;s description
of the vena azygos was incorrect. On the second
convocation Vesalius seems to have disposed of more
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
bodies. He reviewed Galen&rsquo;s work on the joints, and
by numerous specimens, which were prepared by the
students, he demonstrated the difference in the ancient
knowledge of the skeleton. On this occasion he undertook
the complete dissection of an ape and presented its
skeleton, as well as that of a man, to Professor John
Andreas Albius, who held the chair of Hippocratic medicine
in Bologna.</p>
<p>Little is known of the way in which Vesalius taught
surgery. The first year he was in Padua, he began with
Avicenna&rsquo;s treatise on tumors. According to the fragmentary
notes in the college book of his ardent pupil,
Vitus Tritonius, Vesalius compared Avicenna&rsquo;s teachings
with the classical works of Hippocrates, Galen, Paul of
Aegina, and Aetius, explaining and correcting them.</p>

</div>
<p>Like all great teachers,
Vesalius was ever mindful of the interests
of his students. Soon after accepting
the chair of Anatomy in Padua,
he articulated a human skeleton
for use in his class room. His next
work was the preparation of a set of
anatomical plates, <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i>, which were intended
to pave the way to anatomy for beginners. For the
further benefit of his class, he edited an edition of Guinterius&rsquo;s
<i>Institutionuin Anatomicarum</i>, which was issued
in April, 1538.</p>
<h3>Tabulae Anatomicae</h3>
<p>The <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i> were in the form of <i>Fliegende
Bl&auml;tter</i>, or loose leaves, and consisted of six plates
which are now among the rarest of medical works. They
bore the following title:</p>
<p class="center"><i><b>Tabulae Anatomicae. Imprimebat Venetiis B(ernardinus).
<br />Vitalis Venetus sumptibus Joannis Stephani
<br />Calcarensis Prostrant ver&ograve; in officina
<br />D. Bernardini. a. 1538.</b></i></p>
<p>In the preface Vesalius says that no one can learn
either botany or anatomy from figures alone, but illustrations
are a valuable means toward the imparting of
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
knowledge. In publishing these plates he hopes to benefit
those persons who had attended his public dissections.
Not a line in these pictures is unnatural; all has been
reproduced just as he had shown in his demonstrations.
He gives due credit to van Calcar, the artist who made
the drawings of the three skeletons. The other pictures
were made by the author himself.</p>
<p>The <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i> were arranged in the following
order:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I.&mdash;The Portal System and the Organs of Generation;</p>
<p class="t0">II.&mdash;The Venae Cavae and Chief Veins;</p>
<p class="t0">III.&mdash;The Great Artery&mdash;Arteria Magna&mdash;and the Heart;</p>
<p class="t0">IV.&mdash;The Skeleton in its Anterior View;</p>
<p class="t0">V.&mdash;The Skeleton in its Side View;</p>
<p class="t0">VI.&mdash;The Skeleton in its Posterior View.</p>
</div>
<p>The plates are of large dimensions, measuring over
sixteen inches in length, and were cut in wood. Like
those in the <i>Fabrica</i>, they were made in Italy. Owing to
their transient use by medical students, the <i>Tabulae</i> were
soon destroyed, although unauthorized editions were
printed in several cities. The book was dedicated to
Narcissus of Parthenope (Narciso Verdunno, or Vertuneo)
who, in 1520, was first physician to the crown of Naples,
and later, in 1524, was physician and councilor to Charles
the Fifth. It is noteworthy that three of these plates deal
with the skeleton, a subject to which Vesalius had given
much attention. The absence of a plate showing the nervous
system is also to be noted. Vesalius had such a
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
plate prepared, and it appeared in a pirated edition of the
<i>Tabulae</i> which was published at Cologne in 1539. The
large size of these plates, their fidelity to nature, and the
skill with which they were cut in wood, were features
which showed to the world that a real master of anatomy
had been born. The original drawings were made by
Jan Stephan van Calcar, who probably also was the
engraver.</p>
<p>Only two copies of the <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i> are
known. A fine edition of these plates, reproduced by
photography, was privately issued in 1874 by Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell, the talented author of the <i>Annals of the
Artists of Spain</i>.</p>

<p>On the first day of August,
1542, after three years of strenuous
labor, Vesalius completed the <i>Fabrica</i>,
and twelve days later he wrote the last
word of the <i>Epitome</i>. The blocks for
the <i>Fabrica</i>, and also those for the
<i>Epitome</i>, were made in Italy. In the
summer of 1542 they were conveyed to Basel by a merchant
named Danoni and were safely delivered to the printer,
Oporinus. They were accompanied by a long Latin
letter, written by Vesalius to his friend, &ldquo;Joannes Oporinus,
professor of Greek letters in Basel&rdquo;. He begs Oporinus
to take the greatest care that the printed illustrations
shall correspond with the proofs which accompany the
blocks. &ldquo;Every detail must be distinctly visible, so that
each cut shall have the effect of a picture&rdquo;. Early in the
following year Vesalius went to Basel to superintend the
printing of his books. While there, he conducted a demonstration
in anatomy&mdash;the first which had occurred in
that city since 1531&mdash;and presented the articulated skeleton
of the subject to the University. Part of this skeleton
exists today. It is thought to be the oldest anatomical
preparation in existence.</p>
<h3>The Fabrica</h3>
<p>The heart of Vesalius must have filled with joy when
he saw the final page of his book turned from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
press. The treatise which founded modern anatomy
bears this title:&mdash;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="f">Andreae Desalii Brurellensis, Scholae medicorum

<p>A fortune was lavished upon the illustration and publication
of this grand work. To use the words of Fisher,
&ldquo;it was and is a glorious book, a rare and precious monument
of genius, industry and liberality&rdquo;. It abounds
with curious initial letters bearing quaint and interesting
anatomical conceits, each one teaching its lesson. One
of these, reduced in size, introduces the present chapter;
and it was this letter
that Vesalius used in
his opening sentence:
<i>Os caeterarum hominis
partium est durissimum
&amp; ardissimum, maximaque
terrestre &amp; frigidum,
&amp; sensus denique
praeter solos dentes

<p>The first edition of

(1507-1568) of Basel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The title-page is a beautiful engraving which represents
Vesalius at work dissecting a female subject. He is
surrounded by interested spectators who crowd the amphitheatre.
The abdomen of the subject is opened. Vesalius
has raised his left hand; his right hand grasps a
small rod which rests on the viscera. The great teacher
is talking to his pupils. Placed at the head of the dissecting
table is an upright skeleton which grasps a long
staff with its right hand. In the audience are many persons
of different rank. To the left a naked man is climbing
a pillar, while to the right, and below, a dog is being
brought into the arena. To the left, and below, is a
monkey which appears to enjoy the demonstration.
Above, in the architecture, we

<p>Who was the unnamed artist? It is noteworthy that
Vesalius does not state who drew the illustrations, or who
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
cut them in wood, for his <i>Fabrica</i>. He only states that this
book has cost him a monstrous amount of labor in the
preparation of the dissections, and in the directing of the
eye, the hand, and the intelligence of the artist. He
complains bitterly of the obstinacy of the artist, who, at
times so tormented him that he&mdash;Vesalius&mdash;considered
himself more unfortunate than the criminal whose body
had been dissected<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>. It was probably owing to this unpleasant
experience that Vesalius omitted the artist&rsquo;s name.
The great anatomist speaks regretfully of the large sums
which he was obliged to pay, in order to induce skilled
artists to undertake this class of work. He states that
they were much more interested in painting Venus and
The Graces than in drawing pictures of skinned and foul
smelling bodies. Moehsen<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> assumes that Vesalius had
Titian in mind when he penned these thoughts, but this
is questionable. It is not surprising that eminent artists
should have disliked anatomical drawing, at a time when
antiseptic injections and preserving fluids were not known.
Foul odors had no terrors for the great Belgian, who
haunted cemeteries for anatomical material and often kept
parts of cadavers in his bedchamber for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>For a period of two centuries the Vesalian pictures were
ascribed to Titian, but on insufficient grounds. The
famous Venetian painter was over sixty years of age at
the time of the publication of the <i>Fabrica</i>; his services
were much in demand, and he was signally honored by
the Spanish emperor, Charles the Fifth. His powers
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
remained undiminished until shortly before his death,
which occurred in 1576. He had the ability to make
the Vesalian illustrations, but it is doubtful if he had the
time. Although Titian may have taken an interest in
these anatomical plates, it is not now believed that he
drew them.</p>

<p class="pcap">JAN STEPHAN VAN CALCAR</p>
</div>
<p>The Vesalian pictures have been attributed to Christoforo
Coriolano; but he could not have been the artist,
since his earliest work dates from 1568. He is known to
have furnished the drawings for Jerome Mercurialis&rsquo;s
<i>De Arte Gymnastica</i>, and for Vasari&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Painters</i>.
Roth is of the opinion that Vesalius himself made most
of the illustrations; but such a view would credit the
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
comparatively short and busy life of the great anatomist
with too much accomplishment.</p>
<p>I conclude that the illustrations for the <i>Fabrica</i>, like
the osseous figures in the <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i>, which
Vesalius issued in 1538, were made by Jan Stephan van
Calcar (+1546), the favorite pupil of Titian. Sandrart<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
states that van Calcar made the drawings for the <i>Fabrica</i>;
that he went to Venice in 1536 or 1537; that he studied
under Titian; and that his paintings were of such merit
that they were often mistaken for those of Titian, Raphael,
and Rubens.</p>
<p>Van Calcar was a Fleming, a native of Kalcker in the
Duchy of Cleves. The date of his birth is not known.
His death occurred at Naples in 1546. He was highly
esteemed by Vesalius who speaks of him as ranking &ldquo;with
the divine and happy wits of Italy&rdquo;. The anatomical
plates which Vesalius issued in 1538 were made, he states,
by van Calcar:&mdash;<i>sumptibus Joannis Stephani Calcarensis</i>.
These plates, which appeared in the form of pictorial
broad sheets, or <i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i>, may be likened to
the Herald who goes in advance to announce the coming
of the King. They were engraved on wood, and, like
their companion pictures in the <i>Fabrica</i>, they were unprecedented
in magnitude and in minuteness.</p>

<p class="pcap">SECOND VESALIAN PLATE OF THE MUSCLES
<br />(From the &ldquo;Fabrica&rdquo;, 1543. Reduced one-half)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The Vesalian plates vary greatly in merit. The most
satisfactory ones are those depicting the undissected body
and the bones and muscles. The artist was not at his
best in drawing the nervous system, although it is claimed
that Vesalius had prepared his neurologic specimens
with great care. For the use of artists, the best plates
are the three skeletons and the four entire myologic figures
in the <i>Fabrica</i>. The first myologic figure, showing
a man who has been divested of all skin, fat, and superficial
fascia, presents the muscles of the anterior portion
of the body beautifully delineated. Vesalius took much
pride in this plate, and directed the attention of artists to
it. The second plate, which is constructed along similar
lines, shows the body in its lateral aspect. The head is
thrown slightly backward, the right hand pointing to the
earth and the left raised towards the horizon, and the
whole attitude of the subject calls to mind the position
which an orator would assume when addressing an audience.
The third myologic plate is similar to the first one,
but the muscles of the face are exhibited to better advantage
and the aponeuroses, absent in the first plate, are
here present. The fourth plate, which is the ninth in
Vesalius&rsquo;s work (<i>nona musculorum tabula</i>), presents the
muscles of the posterior part of the body. The other
myologic figures show the deeper muscles, layer by layer,
and are of value to an artist who wishes to study the
effect of their action upon the superficial parts of the
body. Hence many of these figures have been reproduced
in works on art-anatomy. The artist who studies
these plates should remember that the figures in question
are divested of skin, fat, and superficial veins&mdash;all of
which must be supplied, in order to avoid giving too great
prominence to the muscles. The two naked figures contained
in the <i>Epitome</i> are properly clothed in skin and
are of great artistic merit. They also are to be seen in
numerous works on art-anatomy. Thus, in one of the
earliest books on anatomy for the use of artists (<i>Abr&eacute;g&eacute;
d&rsquo;anatomie accommod&eacute; aux arts de peinture et de sculpture.</i>
Paris, 1667, 1668), Rogers de Piles and Fran&ccedil;ois
Tortebat have used the three skeletons and seven myologic
figures taken from the <i>Fabrica</i> and the <i>Epitome</i>. In
the preface of his book, de Piles says that he does not
think it is possible to produce better figures than those
found in the works of Vesalius. That he was not alone
in this opinion is shown by the fact that many other artists,
who have composed treatises on art-anatomy, have drawn
freely from the Vesalian storehouse. An Italian, Giacomo
Moro, in his anatomy for the use of artists, (<i>Anatomia
ridotta ad uso de&rsquo; pittori e scultore.</i> Venice 1679),
reproduced nineteen of Vesalius&rsquo;s figures in copperplate.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The popularity of Vesalius&rsquo;s anatomical figures among
painters was due, not only to the intrinsic worth of these
illustrations, but also to the erroneous belief that the original
drawings were the work of Titian. This opinion
found expression on the title-pages of several works on
art-anatomy. For example, in 1706, Moschenbauer, of
Augsburg, issued a folio volume illustrated with Vesalian
figures cut in wood, with this title:&mdash;<i>Andreae Vesalii,
Bruxellensis, des ersten besten Anatomici, Zergliederung
des menschlichen K&ouml;rpers auf Mahlerey, and Bildhauer-Kunst
gerichtet, die Figuren von Titian gezeichnet</i>. An
anonymous book, <i>Notomia di Titanio</i>, appeared in Italy
about the year 1670.</p>
<p>The Vesalian figures of the skeleton were also issued
in single sheets with moralistic verses appended. Moehsen
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
cites one of these with the inscription printed in French:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;De cet objet affreux tu parois rebutt&eacute;,</p>

</div>
<p>Upon the thirteenth day
of August, 1542, Vesalius finished the
<i>Epitome</i> of his great book. The text
and illustrations for it were forwarded
to Basel by the same merchant who
conveyed the manuscript and drawings
of the <i>Fabrica</i>. The title of the
lesser work is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="f">Andreae Vesalii Bruxellensis, Scholae medicorum
<br />Patavinae professoris, suorum de Humani corporis
<br />fabrica librorum Epitome. Basil., et officina
<br />Joannis Oporini, Anno, 1543, mense Junio.</span></p>
<p>This work is extremely rare. It belonged to the class
of <i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i> and was issued unbound. Perfect
copies of it are rarely found. The first twelve sheets are
printed on both sides; the two last leaves are printed on
one side only, in order that they might be cut out and
pasted together to show two complete figures. Hence
these sheets are often lacking. The <i>Epitome</i> appeared in
the same year and in the same month as the <i>Fabrica</i>, but
the latter work was printed first.</p>
<p>The <i>Epitome</i> is dedicated to Philip, the son of Charles
the Fifth, who, after his father&rsquo;s abdication, was known
as Philip the Second of Spain. The title-page is printed
from the same plate as the larger work; and Vesalius&rsquo;s
portrait also is present. From the fact that the dedication
bears the inscription: <i>Patavii, idibus Augusti 1542</i>, the
erroneous opinion arose that this work preceded the
<i>Fabrica</i>.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Among the illustrations found in the <i>Epitome</i> are
seven that are not in the large book; namely, five myologic
plates, and the figure of a naked man and one of a
woman. The myologic figures in the <i>Epitome</i> differ
from those in the <i>Fabrica</i> in this respect: the muscles
are drawn in their natural position, group, and order, so
that the surgeon, in treating wounds and in performing
operations, may have the correct relations of the parts in
mind. Also, the one side of the figure differs from the
other: the one showing the superficial muscles, while the
other exhibits the deeper musculature. The muscles in
the <i>Fabrica</i>, with the exception of four complete myologic
figures, are represented as they appear in anatomical
demonstrations, particular attention being given to their
origins and insertions. For the purpose of the artist, the
best figures are the three skeletons and the four complete
myologic figures which are found in the <i>Fabrica</i>.</p>
<p>Two beautiful copies of the <i>Epitome</i>, printed on vellum,
are in existence. One is in the British Museum and
is thought to be the copy which was owned by the celebrated
Dr. Richard Mead; the other one is in the possession
of the University of Louvain.</p>
<p>Vesalius speaks modestly of the <i>Epitome</i>, which
he regards as an index or appendix of the <i>Fabrica</i>,
and is for the use of beginners in anatomy.</p>

</div>
<p>The reputation of Vesalius
rests securely upon the <i>Fabrica</i>. This
grand book, which is dedicated to
Charles the Fifth, consists of six hundred
and fifty-nine folio pages of text;
thirty-four pages of index, disposed in
three columns to the page; six pages
of preface; and two pages of a letter which is addressed
to &ldquo;Joannes Oporinus, the renowned professor of Greek
letters in Basel&rdquo;. The work is printed in excellent style.
The printed page measures 8 by 12&frac12; inches, including
the marginal notes. There are fifty-seven lines to a page,
averaging twelve words to a line, or approximately seven
hundred words to a page. This was written, amid many
duties and distractions, in the short period of three years.
It is truly a monument of diligence.</p>
<p>The text of the <i>Fabrica</i> is clear and concise; it describes
what has to be described and does it well. The
errors which Vesalius rectified, and the improvements
which he made in anatomy, are so numerous that references
can be made to only a few of them. His anatomical
writings are of such bulk that they cannot be reviewed
adequately within the limits of the present chapter. As
regards the <i>Fabrica</i>, we may say, with Richardson, that
&ldquo;The dissections and the plates are the book&rdquo;.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The <i>Fabrica</i> contains the rudiments of anthropology
as well as the first illustrations of comparative anatomy.
Vesalius portrays a human skull resting upon the skull of
a dog. He also shows a simian and a canine sacrum and
coccyx, to prove his contention that Galen&rsquo;s anatomy was
derived from dissection of the lower animals. The <i>Fabrica</i>
is more than an anatomy. Throughout the work
physiology goes hand in hand with the anatomical description.
The use and function of each part of the body
is given in short, clear sentences.</p>
<p>The <i>Fabrica</i> is built upon a practical plan. It treats
of anatomy in a logical manner and is composed of seven
books, which deal with the following subjects: (1)&mdash;Bones
and Cartilages; (2)&mdash;Ligaments and Muscles; (3)&mdash;Veins
and Arteries; (4)&mdash;Nerves; (5)&mdash;Organs of Nutrition and
Generation; (6)&mdash;Heart and Lungs; and (7)&mdash;Brain and
Organs of Sense.</p>
<h3>The First Book</h3>
<p>Vesalius devotes one hundred and sixty-eight pages to
the bones and cartilages, treating these structures with a
thoroughness that amazed his contemporaries. He was
the first author who correctly described the osseous system
as a whole. In numerous instances Vesalius places
himself in direct opposition to the opinions of Galen. He
denied the existence of the intermaxillary bone in adults,
and showed that the inferior maxilla does not consist of
two pieces, as has been asserted by Galen. The seven
bones of the sternum were reduced to three by Vesalius.
He denied Galen&rsquo;s statement that the bones of the symphysis
pubis separate during parturition. He was the
first anatomist to give an accurate description of the
sphenoid bone. A small aperture at the root of the
pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone is called <i>foramen
Vesalii</i>. Vesalius proved the existence of marrow in the
bones of the hand, which had been denied by Galen. In
all respects, he wrote more intelligently of the bones than
any anatomist who had preceded him.</p>

<h3>The Second Book</h3>
<p>Vesalius devotes one hundred and eighty-eight pages
to a description of the ligaments and the muscles. This
part of his treatise, while it contains a few errors and does
not reach the high plane of the first book, is superior to
any work of its kind that had preceded it. Vesalius was
the first writer to describe the internal pterygoid muscle.
He denied the existence of a general muscle of the skin,
and stated that the intercostal muscles merely separate the
ribs without expanding or contracting the thorax. He
held the view that nerves and muscles do not stand in
any relation of proportionate strength to one another,
large nerves often being distributed to small muscles.
He also held that the tendons are similar in structure to
the ligaments.</p>

<p>Vesalius&rsquo;s plates of the superficial muscles are among
the most beautiful that have ever appeared. They have
been copied in practically all later treatises on anatomy,
and have been used extensively by art-anatomists. His
plates of the deeper muscles, while naturally not so
pleasing to the eye, are wonderfully near accuracy. The
different muscles are drawn to show function as well
as structure.</p>
<h3>The Third Book</h3>
<p>The third part of the <i>Fabrica</i>, comprising sixty pages,
is devoted to the veins and arteries. Vesalius begins with
the definition of a vein, and describes the structure of
these vessels in general. The term &ldquo;artery&rdquo; is treated in
like manner. He introduces several small illustrations
which serve to elucidate this part of the text. His first
large plate in this section is devoted to the venae portae.
This is followed by a full-page picture of the entire venous
system. The arterial system is fully described and
elaborately illustrated. To these is added another plate,
in which both arteries and veins are represented in their
natural order. In other plates he shows the special circulations&mdash;cerebral,
portal, and pulmonary.</p>

<p>Vesalius described the valve which guards the foramen
ovale in the foetus, and also noticed the valve-like fold
which guards the entrance of each hepatic vein into the
inferior vena cava. He also gave an admirable description
of the vena azygos. Blinded by the ancient theory
of the movement of the blood&mdash;a sort of flux and reflux
in the veins, he overlooked the function of the venous
valves. He described them as eminences, or projections,
or accidental rugosities, which in no way interfere with
the flux and reflux of the blood.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Book</h3>
<p>Vesalius devotes forty pages to the cerebral and spinal
nerves. The anatomy of the brain is treated in the seventh
book. His representations of the nerves are very creditable.
He mentions eleven pairs of cranial nerves: the
olfactory, the optic, the motores oculorum, the trifacial,
the abducens, the portio dura, the portio mollis, the
glosso-pharyngeal, the pneumogastric, and the spinal
accessory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>His account of the brain&mdash;contained in the seventh
book&mdash;is elaborately minute considering the time when it
was written. His illustrations and description of this
organ surpass those of scores of later authors. Vesalius
fully describes the position of the brain; the membranes
which cover it; the cavities, or ventricles, within it; the
divisions of cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla; the anatomy
of the base, and the origins of the cerebral nerves.
These structures are illustrated from different points of
view.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Book</h3>
<p>The fifth book, comprising more than one hundred
pages, is devoted to the organs of nutrition. Here we
find an admirable account of the peritoneum, the mesentery,
the omentum, the stomach and intestines, the liver,
the spleen, and the genito-urinary tract&mdash;all of which
structures are described and fully illustrated. In this
book Vesalius also describes the foetus in utero.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Book</h3>
<p>In less than fifty pages Vesalius describes the contents
of the thorax. He writes intelligently of the membrane
lining the thorax, and then gives an account of the arteria
aspera, as the trachea was formerly named. Passing on
to the lungs, he next takes up the anatomy of the heart.
He describes its position, form, and structure in better
terms than had been done by preceding anatomists. The
auricles, ventricles, and valves are carefully examined.
His illustrations of both lungs and heart are excellent.</p>
<p>In the 1543 edition of the <i>Fabrica</i>, Vesalius adopts
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
the erroneous view of Galen that openings exist in the
septum of the heart. In the second edition of his book,
published in 1555, he says that influenced by the views of
Galen, he believed that the blood passes from the right to
the left ventricle of the heart, through the septum, by
means of the pores. Vesalius immediately adds that the
septum of the heart is as dense and compact as the rest
of this organ, and that not the smallest quantity of blood
passes through the septum.</p>
<p>His account of this subject is best given in his own
words:&mdash;&ldquo;In recounting as above the structure of the
heart, and the use of its different parts, I have followed in
the main the doctrines of Galen; not that I regard them
in all particulars as consonant with the truth, but because,
in attributing new functions and uses to a number of
parts, I am still distrustful of myself, and not long ago
should hardly have ventured to differ from that Prince of
Physicians by so much as a finger&rsquo;s breadth. As for the
dividing wall, or septum, between the ventricles forming
the right side of the left cavity, the student of anatomy
should consider carefully that it is equally thick, compact,
and dense, with all the rest of the cardiac substance enclosing
the left ventricle. And accordingly, notwithstanding
what I have said about the pits in this situation,
and at the same time not forgetting the absorption by the
portal vein from the stomach and intestines, I still do not
see how even the smallest quantity of blood can be transfused,
through the substance of the septum, from the
right ventricle to the left&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Vesalius and other anatomists knew of the hepatic
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
circulation, or at least believed in some communication
between the portal and hepatic veins:&mdash;&ldquo;The branches of
this vein&rdquo;&mdash;vena cava&mdash;&ldquo;distributed through the body of
the liver, come in contact with those of the portal vein;
and the extreme ramifications of these veins inosculate
with each other, and in many places appear to unite and
be continuous&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Vesalius knew that in several particulars the accepted
physiology of the vascular system was wrong. If he could
have lived a few years longer, it is possible that he might
have solved the great problem which was made clear by
William Harvey. In the light of our present knowledge
some of Vesalius&rsquo;s words are suggestive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When these matters are taken into account, many
things at once present themselves in regard to the arterial
system, which deserve careful consideration; especially
the fact that there is hardly a single vein going to the
stomach, the intestines, or even the spleen, without its
accompanying artery, and that nearly every member of
the portal system has a companion artery associated with
it in its course. Again, the arteries going to the kidneys
are of such size that they can by no means be affirmed
to serve merely for regulating the heat of these organs;
and still less can we assert that so many arteries are distributed
to the stomach, intestines and spleen for that
purpose alone. And there is, furthermore, the fact, which
we must for many reasons admit, that there is through
the arteries and veins a mutual flux and reflux of materials,
and that within these vessels the weight and gravitation
of their contents has no effect&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h3>The Seventh Book.</h3>
<p>In the seventh book, consisting of less than sixty pages,
Vesalius fully describes the anatomy of the brain, of the
cranial nerves, and of the organs of sense. His description
of the eye is not as near accuracy as might be expected.
He places the crystalline lens in the centre of the
globe. His description of the organ of vision was only
slightly better than that which was given by Galen. Vesalius
showed, however, that the optic nerve is not a hollow
tube, and that it does not enter the eyeball exactly in the
antero-posterior axis.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Considering the time in which he lived, Vesalius was
remarkably free from errors. Although to him the arteries
were carriers of vital spirits, the veins were the true
blood vessels, and, according to the first edition of his
great book, the septum of the heart was filled with foramina;
yet, we must say with Baas, &ldquo;these are all mere
shadows necessary to the brilliancy of the picture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Vesalius was more than an anatomist. As a practical
physician he had the highest reputation among his
contemporaries. He was an accomplished scholar and
was thoroughly conversant with the weaknesses of human
nature, as is evident from many satirical touches in
his writings. Although his great work contains many
errors that a tyro of the present day would laugh at, it
laid the foundations of our knowledge. Vesalius overthrew
the idol of authority in anatomy and taught us to
look at Nature with our own eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Portal<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> has paid a splendid tribute to Vesalius. &ldquo;Vesalius&rdquo;,
he says, &ldquo;appears to me one of the greatest men who
ever existed. Let the astronomers vaunt their Copernicus,
the natural philosophers their Galileo and Torricelli, the
mathematicians their Pascal, the geographers their Columbus,
I shall always place Vesalius above all their heroes.
The first study of man is man. Vesalius has this noble
object in view, and has admirably attained it; he has made
on himself and his fellows such discoveries as Columbus
could make only by travelling to the extremity of the
world. The discoveries of Vesalius are of direct importance
to man; by acquiring fresh knowledge of his own
structure, man seems to enlarge his existence; while discoveries
in geography or astronomy affect him but in a
very indirect manner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like Harvey, Vesalius was obliged to defend his
writings from fierce attacks. The most desperate of his
opponents was his old master, Jacobus Sylvius, who was so
wedded to the Galenic teachings that he asserted that
since Galen&rsquo;s time the thigh bones had changed their
shape. He spoke of Vesalius as a &ldquo;madman, Vesanus,
whose pestilential breath poisons Europe&rdquo;. Ponderous
discussions were carried on between the friends and opponents
of the great anatomist. The complete overthrow
of the Galenists resulted.</p>
<p>If Vesalius had remained professor of anatomy in Padua,
instead of being appointed physician to Charles the Fifth,
at Madrid, in 1544, it is probable that the circulation of
the blood would have been discovered by him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In recent years attempts have been made to show that
it was not Vesalius, but Leonardo da Vinci, who was the
founder of modern anatomy. A considerable amount of
controversial literature has accumulated on this subject.
For our purpose it may suffice to quote the conclusions of
McMurrich<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;Leonardo was the first to create a new
anatomy, but he created it for himself alone; Vesalius demonstrated
a new anatomy to the world. It was the publication
of Vesalius&rsquo;s <i>Fabrica</i> that revolutionized anatomy,
while Leonardo&rsquo;s drawings were lying unpublished, at
first the cherished possessions of his favorite pupil Melzi,
later in the Ambrosian Library in Milan, and still later
forgotten in the Royal Library at Windsor. We must
credit Leonardo as being the forerunner of the new anatomy,
but Vesalius must be recognized as its founder&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication
of the <i>Fabrica</i>, great activity was
manifested in anatomic research, and
numerous opponents and critics of
Vesalius appeared in the arena of
science. The criticism of such men
as Jacobus Sylvius and John Dryander,
while it was of a violent type, was of much less importance
than was that of Eustachius, Columbus and Fallopius.
Vesalius was not without his partisans, of whom
Ingrassias and Cannanus are worthy of mention.</p>
<h3>Bartholomeus Eustachius</h3>
<p>Eustachius was born at San Severino, a small city near
Salernum, about the year 1520. He studied anatomy in
Rome and made remarkable progress in this science. In
the year 1562, as he informs us in his <i>Opuscula Anatomica</i>,
he was professor of medicine in the Collegio della
Sapienza at Rome. Like many other men of genius,
Eustachius died in poverty. In August, 1574, having been
called by the illness of Cardinal Rovere to Fossombrone,
Eustachius died upon the journey.</p>
<p>To Eustachius posterity is indebted for a series of
splendid copperplate engravings which were designed to
illustrate the anatomy of the human body. These plates,
the handiwork of Eustachius, and the first anatomical
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
illustrations wrought in copper, were completed in 1552,
only nine years after the first impression of the book of
Vesalius. Unfortunately for himself, and worse for medical
science, Eustachius was unable to publish them. If
this magnificent atlas of anatomy could have been published
when completed, the anatomical discoveries of the
eighteenth century would have come two hundred years
earlier. Unfortunately the entire text of the work is lost.
For one hundred and thirty-eight years the Eustachian
plates remained either in the family of Pinus, an intimate
friend of the anatomist, or were buried in the Papal Library
at Rome. When discovered they were presented by
Pope Clement XI. to his physician, Lancisi, who published
them with notes of his own, at Rome, in 1714. In
1740 they were issued under the direction of Cajetan
Petrioli. Four years later the edition by Albinus appeared,
which was republished in 1761. The anatomical
writings of Eustachius were published during his lifetime,
in 1564. It is upon his <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i> that the
fame of this wonderful man is founded. If this work had
been published in 1552, Eustachius would have divided
with Vesalius the honor of founding human anatomy.
The victim of circumstances, his name has been overshadowed
by that of Vesalius, to whom in some respects he
was superior. Deprived during life of his merited honors,
Eustachius has been awarded a goodly share of posthumous
fame.</p>

</div>
<p>Eustachius was the first anatomist to describe, with any
degree of accuracy, the tube which bears his name. We
can truly say he discovered it, since Alcmaeon dissected
only the lower animals, and was not an accurate observer,
as his view that goats breathe through the ears, amply
testifies. Eustachius discovered the tensor tympani and
stapedius muscles, the modiolus and membranous cochlea,
and the stapes. The honor of the discovery of the stapes
is claimed for no less than five renowned anatomists,
namely, Fallopius, Ingrassias, Columbus, Colladus, and
Eustachius. It is unnecessary to discuss this disputed
claim to priority. The truth seems to be that the stapes
was discovered by both Ingrassias and Eustachius, each
independently of the other. In 1546 Ingrassias publicly
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
demonstrated the little bone of the ear in his lectures at
Naples. Fallopius, after learning from an eyewitness
that Ingrassias had actually discovered and named the
ossicle, relinquished his claim to the discovery. Columbus
and Colladus filed their information at too late a date.
Eustachius, as previously stated, finished his anatomical
plates in 1552. His seventh plate shows, among other
subjects, the auditory ossicles&mdash;malleus, incus and stapes&mdash;and
tensor tympani muscle. These objects are delineated
as taken from a human subject, and also from a dog.</p>
<p>Eustachius discovered the origin of the optic nerves,
and the sixth cerebral nerves. He gives excellent pictures
of the corpora olivaria and corpora pyramidalia; of the
stylo-hyoid muscle; of the deep muscles of the neck and
throat; of the suprarenal capsules, and of the thoracic
duct. He also described the ciliary muscle. Eustachius
was the first anatomist who accurately studied the teeth
and the phenomena of the first and second dentition. In
his researches he employed magnifying glasses, maceration,
exsiccation, and various methods of injection.</p>
<h3>Realdus Columbus</h3>
<p>The first anatomical treatise containing an account of
the lesser, or pulmonary circulation, was the monumental
work, <i>De Re Anatomica, libri xv.</i>, written by Realdus
Columbus and sumptuously published at Venice in the
year 1559. This, however, was not the first printed account
of the lesser circulation. Six years prior to the
publication of the book of Columbus, the unfortunate
Servetus, in a theological treatise, described correctly the
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
course of the blood in its transit through the lungs.
Tried for heresy, Servetus was burned, together with all
obtainable copies of his book. Although it had been
printed, the work was suppressed; hence it follows that
Columbus was the first to publish the great discovery.
Of the life of this anatomist we know but little. Born at
Cremona, a small Milanese village, the year of his birth
is unknown. He died in 1559, while his book was being
printed. A few copies were finished before his demise,
since a copy belonging to the late Dr. George Jackson
Fisher, of Sing Sing, N.Y., contains the author&rsquo;s own dedication
to Pope Paul IV., while in other exemplars, the dedication
has been written by the two sons of Columbus, and
is addressed to &ldquo;<i>Pio IIII., Pont. Max</i>&rdquo;. This prelate, on
the death of Paul IV., on August 18, 1559, became the
head of the Church.</p>
<p>Some writers have held that the discovery of the lesser
circulation was not made by Columbus independently of
Servetus, but that a copy of the book of Servetus had
drifted into Italy and had been read by Columbus. There
is no direct evidence to support this view. When Vesalius
was called to Madrid as physician to Charles the
Fifth, Columbus, in 1544, succeeded him in the University
of Padua; two years later he filled the anatomical
chair at Pisa, and in 1546, Pope Paul IV. called him to
Rome. Here he spent the later years of his life, engaged
in teaching anatomy and in writing his book. For forty
years Columbus pursued his anatomical studies, and in
that period he dissected an unusually large number of
bodies. Fourteen subjects passed under his scalpel in a
single year.</p>

<p class="pcap">TITLE-PAGE OF COLUMBUS&rsquo;S ANATOMY
<br />(Reduced one-half)</p>
</div>
<p>Columbus frequently made experiments upon living
animals. He was the first to use dogs for such purposes,
preferring them to swine. Book XIIII. of the work of
Columbus is upon the subject of vivisection, <i>De viva
sectione</i>. In this he tells us how to employ living dogs
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
in demonstrating the movements of the heart and brain,
the action of the lungs, etc. Columbus was the first
anatomist who demonstrated experimentally that the blood
passes from the lungs into the pulmonary veins. &ldquo;When
the heart dilates&rdquo;, says Columbus, &ldquo;it draws natural blood
from the vena cava into the right ventricle, and prepared
blood from the pulmonary vein into the left; the valves
being so disposed that they collapse and permit its ingress;
but when the heart contracts, they become tense, and
close the apertures, so that nothing can return by the way
it came. The valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery
opening, on the contrary, at the same moment, give passage
to the spirituous blood for distribution to the body
at large, and to the natural blood for transference to the
lungs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like Servetus, Columbus held to the idea of &ldquo;spiritus&rdquo;.
Harvey was the first physiologist who recognized the circulation
as purely a movement of blood. All before him
assumed the existence of a mixture of air and blood.
Columbus, pupil and prosector of Vesalius, like his great
master, denied the existence of foramina in the cardiac
septum.</p>
<h3>Gabriel Fallopius</h3>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>

<img src="images/p_p122.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">GABRIEL FALLOPIUS</p>
</div>
<p>Gabriel Fallopius (1523-1562), of Modena, was a noted
Italian anatomist. In his twenty-fifth year he was made
professor of anatomy at Pisa. Although the span of his
life was short, he will be remembered always as the discoverer
of the tubes which bear his name. According to
Fisher, Fallopius &ldquo;described the ear more minutely than
had ever before been done. He discovered the little
canal along which the facial nerve passes after leaving
the auditory; it is still called the <i>aquaeductus Fallopii</i>.
He demonstrated the fact of the communication of the
mastoid cells with the cavity of the tympanum; and also
described the fenestrae rotunda and ovalis. In the treatment
of diseases of the ear, he used an aural speculum,
and employed sulphuric acid for the removal of polypi
from the meatus. In some of his supposed discoveries
he had long been anticipated; for example, the tubes
which bear his name were known and accurately described
by Herophilus, over three hundred years before the
Christian era, and also by Rufus of Ephesus, of whom
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Galen speaks as the best anatomist of the second century.
Rufus refers to two varicose and tortuous vessels passing
from the testes (as the ovaries were called) to the cavity
of the uterus. Fallopius, however, gave a full account of
their course, position, size and structure. He cut into
them and found them hollow, gave them the name of
tubae seminales, and posterity attached his name to them,
and in time came to a better comprehension of their true
function. This is not the only instance in the history of
anatomical discovery where the name of a person, not its
discoverer, has been given to an organ. Allusion has
been made to Fallopius as a botanist; a genus of plants,
<i>Fallopia</i>, has been named in honor of him&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fallopius was appointed professor of anatomy at
Pisa, in the year 1548; and later, at the instance of the
Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I., he received a professorship
at Padua, as successor to Vesalius. Besides
the chair of anatomy and surgery and of botany, he also
held the office of superintendent of the new botanic garden
in that city. Fallopius remained in Padua to the day
of his death, which occurred in 1562. He was very
properly succeeded by his favorite pupil, Fabricius ab
Aquapendente, who had been for some time previously
his anatomical demonstrator. His collected works, as
published in Venice, 1606, embrace twenty-four treatises
distributed in three folio volumes. Only one of his works
was published during his lifetime, namely, his <i>Observationes
Anatomicae</i>, Venice, 1561, which is considered one
of his most valuable books, containing, as it does, most of
his discoveries and his animadversions on the works of
other anatomists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>This was written as a supplement to the anatomy of
Vesalius, for it follows the same order, passes upon the
same subjects, corrects the inaccuracies of the Vesalian
treatise, and supplies what is wanting. Throughout the
work Fallopius treats Vesalius with great respect, and
never mentions him without an honorable title. Vesalius
wrote an answer to this work, entitled, <i>Observationum
Fallopii examen</i>, in which he acknowledges the courtesy
of Fallopius, but, as argument progresses, appears to be
out of temper.</p>
<p>After the death of Fallopius it was thought that no
successor except Vesalius could be found competent to
fill his place. Accordingly Vesalius was chosen. The
news of his appointment reached him while he was returning
from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Unfortunately
he was shipwrecked and perished, otherwise history would
have afforded an example of the master filling the chair
of the pupil.</p>
<h3>John Philip Ingrassias</h3>
<p>Ingrassias, who lived between the years 1510-1580,
was a graduate of the celebrated Paduan School. He
described minutely the anatomy of the ear, including the
tympanum, fenestrae rotunda and ovalis, the cochlea, the
semi-circular canals, and the tensor tympani muscle. His
admiring pupils caused his portrait to be painted and
placed in the Neapolitan School, with this inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;To
Philip Ingrassias, of Sicily, who, by his lectures, restored
the science of true Medicine and Anatomy in
Naples, his pupils have suspended this portrait as a mark
of grateful remembrance&rdquo;. Ingrassias was a voluminous
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
writer, his chief work being a treatise on osteology, which
was published twenty-three years after his death. When
the plague depopulated Palermo, in 1575, his devotion was
such as to earn for him the title of the Sicilian Hippocrates.
Few men have been more earnest workers in medical science.
If his fame as an anatomist has not equalled that of
others, the cause is to be sought in the multiplicity of
competitors, not in lack of zeal and ability.</p>

</div>
<p>Medical history furnishes
numerous examples of literary theft.
In many instances an entire set of anatomical
plates has been pirated by unscrupulous
publishers. In a few cases
both text and plates have been appropriated
by medical authors. The most
notorious example of this form of theft was furnished by
William Cowper (1666-1709), an English surgeon and
anatomist, who, having secured three hundred copies of
Bidloo&rsquo;s set of one hundred and five anatomical plates, in
1697 issued the work<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> as his own. Cowper added a few
original illustrations to the book.</p>
<p>Vesalius suffered severely at the hands of the plagiarists.
Pirated editions of the <i>Tabulae Anatomicae</i> were
printed in several cities, chiefly in Germany. As regards
the <i>Fabrica</i>, we may say that it has been the fountain
from which many anatomical writers have derived practically
all of their illustrations and much of their text.</p>
<p>The fame of the <i>Fabrica</i> soon spread throughout Europe.
It was published in Germany, in Holland and in
England. An epitome of its contents was issued in Latin,
in 1545, by Thomas Geminus, or Gemini, under the title:&mdash;<i>Compendiosa
totius Anatomiae delineatio, aere exaratum
per Thomam. Geminum.</i> It contained forty of the Vesalian
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
plates, cut in copper, and was the first book issued in
England in which the roller printing process was employed.
It was dedicated to Henry the Eighth, and was embellished
with &ldquo;one of the earliest and most curious of all
extant engraved title-pages&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In 1553, Geminus issued a second edition, in which
the text was translated into English. This edition was
dedicated to Edward the Sixth, with a commendatory note,
&ldquo;To the gentill readers and Surgeons of Englande&rdquo;. Six
years later the third English edition appeared, which was
inscribed to Queen Elizabeth. It contains the first published
portrait of the Queen. She is shown upon the engraved
title-page, and, strange to say, above her is another
queenly figure, with a pen in her right hand, a wreath on
her left, her foot resting on the globe, and styled <i>Victoria</i>.</p>
<p>Another English work on anatomy, which is filled
with poor imitations of Vesalius&rsquo;s illustrations, is the
<i>Microcosmographia</i> of Helkiah Crooke, or Crocus, who
was &ldquo;Professor in Anatomy and Chirurgery&rdquo;. Its chief
value rests in an elaborately engraved title-page, a part of
which shows Crooke giving a demonstration in anatomy
in the presence of the &ldquo;Worshipfull Company of Barber-Chirurgeons&rdquo;,
in London, early in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>John Banister of Nottingham, in 1578, borrowed a
few Vesalian woodcuts for use in <i>The Historie of Man,
sucked from the sappe of the most approved Anatomists
and published for the Utilitie of all Godly Chirurgians
within this Realme</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the host of translators, epitomizers, commentators
and imitators of Vesalius have passed into oblivion.
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
A few of these persons have possessed enough of individuality
to deserve recognition.</p>
<p>Juan Valverde di Hamusco, a Spaniard who was born
about the year 1500, studied anatomy at Padua and later
at Rome. His book, <i>Historia de la Composicion del
Cuerpo Humano</i>, was published at Rome in 1556. It
contains forty-two copperplates and an engraved title-page.
Although the author says he has used only the Vesalian
plates, his work contains several plates which are not to
be found in Vesalius&rsquo;s writings. For example, Valverde
shows a <i>muskelmann</i> with his skin held in his right hand,
the left grasping a dagger which may have been used in
the skinning process. Other original drawings show the
abdomen and intestines, a pregnant woman with the abdomen
opened, and illustrations of the superficial veins.</p>
<p>Valverde was physician to Cardinal Juan de Toledo,
Archbishop of Santiago, to whom the work is dedicated.
The illustrations were drawn by Gaspar Becerra and were
engraved by Nicholas Beatrizet. Valverde&rsquo;s book went
through several editions. It forms a landmark in the
medical history of Spain&mdash;a country which, for many years,
was behind other states of Europe in matters of science.</p>
<p>To name the list of anatomical writers who have derived
their artistic inspiration from the <i>Fabrica</i> would require
much more space than is at our disposal. It must
suffice to say, that, for a period of two centuries, nearly
all treatises on anatomy contained illustrations which were
taken from the writings of Vesalius. With few exceptions,
these reproductions were little better than caricatures
of the original figures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Of the numerous editions of the <i>Fabrica</i> there are
three which are highly prized, namely, the first one, 1543;
the second, issued in 1555, containing eight hundred and
twenty-four pages, with many changes in the text; and
the 1725 edition of the collected writings of Vesalius.
The last named is a huge volume which was published at
Leyden under the supervision of Boerhaave and Albinus,
with the illustrations cut in copper by Jan Wandelaar<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>.</p>
<p>It contains the <i>Fabrica</i>, the <i>Epitome</i>, the <i>Epistola de
Radicis Chynae</i>, various anatomical treatises of a controversial
character, and the <i>Chirurgia Magna</i> which has
been wrongly attributed to Vesalius. Morley says of this
book:&mdash;&ldquo;After his death a great work on surgery appeared,
in seven books, signed with his name, and commonly
included among his writings. There is reason, however,
to believe that his name was stolen to give value to the
book, which was compiled and published by a Venetian,
Prosper Bogarucci, a literary crow, who fed himself upon
the dead man&rsquo;s reputation&rdquo;.</p>

</div>
<p>Vesalius, having finished
the <i>Fabrica</i>, intended to write a work
on the practice of medicine which
should be based on pathology. He
makes mention of this in the preface
of the <i>Fabrica</i>, and in numerous
places in the body of the book he describes
the pathologic appearances which he found in
dissection.</p>
<p>Returning to Padua after a year&rsquo;s absence, he found
that the University for which he had strenuously labored
was a very hotbed of opposition. His former pupil and
friend, Realdus Columbus, who was now lecturing on
anatomy at Padua, had turned against him. How deeply
Vesalius was wounded by the man whom he had made,
can be appreciated only by those who have been placed
in similar circumstances. The controversy between
Columbus and Vesalius was of a bitter and personal
character.</p>
<p>On all sides the views of Vesalius were attacked, and
the defenders of Galen joined hands with men like Columbus
in an effort to besmirch the great anatomist. Disgusted
with such treatment, Vesalius, early in 1544, went
to Pisa. Here he conducted a course in anatomy. Leaving
Pisa, he went to Bologna where he made some special
dissections upon two bodies. About this time he declined
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
a chair in the University of Pisa which was tendered to
him by direction of Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici. Tired of the apparently
useless effort to make men see the truth, sick of
disputes and arguments, persecuted by members of his
own profession, in a fit of passion Vesalius threw his
manuscripts into the fire and ended his career as a scientist.
&ldquo;Thus&rdquo;, says Morley, &ldquo;he destroyed a huge volume
of annotations upon Galen; a whole book of Medical
Formulae; many original notes upon drugs; the copy of
Galen from which he lectured, covered with marginal
notes of new observations
that had occurred to him
while demonstrating; and
the paraphrase of the
books of Rhazes, in
which the knowledge of
the Arabians was collated
with that of the Greeks
and others&rdquo;.</p>

that he should have accepted

of Archiatrus to Charles
the Fifth of Spain.</p>
<p>The great Emperor was now at the zenith of his fame.
His kingdom, which reached from South America to the
Zuyder Zee, was well under control, but the monarch already
contemplated the abdication of the throne in favor of
his son Philip, who is known in history as Philip the Second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Vesalius left Italy and took up his residence at Madrid.
He was now in his thirtieth year. As Archiatrus he accompanied
the Emperor in the fourth French war, in
which he gained his first experience as a military surgeon.
He also acted as physician to Charles and to the members
of the imperial household. The war ended in September
1544. In January, 1545, Charles went to Brussels, and
remained in the Netherlands for many months. Vesalius
was now in his native country, and in April, 1546, he
visited the graves of his ancestors at Nymwegen and
Wesel. In the same year he published a new edition of
his treatise on the China root.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fifth day of October, 1555, amid a scene
of pomp and splendor, in the presence of the assembled
representatives of the Netherlands, Charles formally surrendered
to his son all his territories, jurisdiction and authority
in the Low-Countries. This was the first of a series
of acts by which the Emperor gradually relinquished
the reins of power, in order to spend his remaining days in
a cloister. Philip thus became the heir to a vast dominion.
Vesalius was continued in office as Archiatrus by the new
Emperor. From both Charles and Philip, Vesalius received
many marks of honor. It was he who rescued
Charles from what was thought to be a mortal disease. At
a later date, when Philip&rsquo;s unfortunate son, Don Carlos,
received a severe injury to the head, and after the treatment
of the Spanish physicians had failed, it was Vesalius
who saved his life by an operation. These cures, and
the accurate prediction of the death-day of Maximilian
d&rsquo;Egmont, placed the fame of Vesalius at high tide.</p>

</div>
<p>Suddenly, early in the year
1564, for a reason which has never been
explained satisfactorily, Vesalius left
Madrid. Apparently he was at the
height of success. He was famous as
a physician and surgeon; he was a
favorite at the Spanish court; he had amassed a fortune;
and seemingly he was destined to pass his remaining days
under the most favorable surroundings. As occurs to all
great men, he had excited the jealous animosity of many
of the members of his profession. The efforts of the
Madrid physicians to ignore the talents of one whom they
regarded as a foreigner, long since had reacted to
the advantage of the Archiatrus.</p>

<p class="pcap">PHILIP THE SECOND</p>
</div>
<p>During the twenty years
that he had filled the post
of Archiatrus, the scalpel
of Vesalius was rusting:
but the controversy concerning
the infallibility of
Galen was still raging. The
violent criticisms of Sylvius
upon the <i>Fabrica</i> had been
silenced by death, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
others took up the cause of Galen where Sylvius had
left it. But the passing years had brought a new coterie
of professors, who, like Fallopius at Padua; Rondelet at
Montpellier; Massa at Venice; and Fuchs at T&uuml;bingen,
were boldly teaching many things that were contrary to
Galen.</p>
<p>Life at the Spanish court was not favorable to the study
of science. &ldquo;The hand of the Church&rdquo;, says Foster<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>, &ldquo;was
heavy on the land; the dagger of the Inquisition was stabbing
at all mental life, and its torch was a sterilizing flame
sweeping over all intellectual activity. The pursuit of
natural knowledge had become a crime, and to search with
the scalpel into the secrets of the body of man was accounted
sacrilege. It was for a life in priest-ridden, ignorant,
superstitious Madrid that Vesalius had forsaken the
freedom of the Venetian Republic and the bright academic
circles of Padua; in Madrid, where, as he himself
has said, &lsquo;he could not lay his hand on so much as a dried
skull, much less have the chance of making a dissection&rsquo;.
Moreover, he must have felt the loss of Charles, who,
whatever his faults, recognized the worth of intellectual
efforts, and in many ways had shown his sympathy with
Vesalius&rsquo;s love of knowledge. Such sympathy could not
be looked for in the narrow and bigoted Philip&rdquo;.</p>
<p>About this time Vesalius received a copy of the <i>Observationes
Anatomicae</i> of his pupil Fallopius, who, having
learned all that his master had taught of anatomy, continued
his studies with great skill and industry. Such a
book, coming at an opportune time, must have seemed
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
like a voice calling the Archiatrus back to the intellectual
life, bringing to his mind&rsquo;s eye the recollection of his happy
days in Italy.</p>
<p>Vesalius travelled to Venice by way of Perpignan.
While in Venice he visited the printer, Francesco Sanese,
and discussed the publication of a new book which
should contain his reply to Fallopius. In a short time
he started for Cyprus in company with Jacobo Malatesta,
the commander of the Venetian forces in that island.
Thence he passed to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land. Vesalius never returned from that journey.
Information of his death reached Brussels towards the end
of that year&mdash;1564.</p>
<p>What was the reason for this pilgrimage? Various
alleged authorities have given different versions, many of
which are evidently fictitious. The most reasonable account,
which emanates from Spanish-French sources,
dates from a letter written January 1, 1565, to the physician
Caspar Peucer by Hubert Languer, or Hubertus Languetus,
the Huguenot friend of Philip Sidney, which says:&mdash;&ldquo;They
say that Vesalius is dead. Doubtless you have
heard that he went to Jerusalem. That journey had, as
they tell us from Spain, an odd reason. Vesalius, believing
a young Spanish nobleman whom he had attended to
be dead, obtained leave of the parents to open the body
for the sake of inquiring into the cause of the illness,
which he had not rightly comprehended. This was granted;
but he had no sooner made an incision into the body
than he perceived the symptoms of life, and opening the
breast, saw the heart beat. The parents coming afterwards
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
to the knowledge of this, were not satisfied with
prosecuting him for murder, but accused him to the Inquisition
of impiety, in hopes that he would be punished
with greater rigor by the judges of that tribunal than
by those of the common law. But the King of Spain interposed,
and saved him on condition that by way of
atoning for the error he should undertake a pilgrimage to
the Holy Land&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The pilgrimage was made, the Holy Sepulcher was
visited, and the weary wanderer had started for Padua to
take the chair which was made vacant by the death of
Fallopius. A violent storm swept the Ionian Sea. Vesalius&rsquo;s
ship was wrecked upon the island of Zakynthos,
where, on the fifteenth day of October, 1564, the Archiatrus
died of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Such was the miserable end of Andreas Vesalius of
Brussels, a man, who, before he had attained his thirtieth
year, had become the greatest anatomist that the world
has ever seen.</p>
